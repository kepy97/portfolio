As everyone knows, currently react is boomming the market.</p> <p>This is my first post of the blogging. Currently, there is a COVID-19 pandemic situation in every country. My university classes converted to online so I have free time to improve my programming. So, I will convert my html site to react by own. Also, I will use github pages to host my website. Currently, github pages allows to host free without any backend language. So, I will not use any backend programming and database.</p> <p>This is it for the first blog. Thank you.

         "body": "<h2 class=\"mb-3\"> Finally, Got an Internship in Fortune 500 Company!! </h2> <p>As an international student, it is very hard to secure the internship in USA. In fact, international student even can't get phone interview so getting a video or in-person interview is a big achievement. In this post, I will write whole internship hunting experience.</p> <p>I'm a graduate student at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. I enrolled in fall 2019. In starting of November 2019, I started to apply for the internship application. Big companies already started to hire interns. I show many student post about they got the offer for Summer 2020 internship. I was feeling nervous because I'm getting only online coding challenges. It was bad time for me..</p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Created Personal Website</h2> <p>I started wondering about what is wrong in my application. And I figured out it's because I'm on F-1 visa. Companies are looking for long-term players only and they have to pay extra money for sponserships. That's the main problem.</p> <p>I need to do something different than other applications so I thought I should create my portfolio. Many people suggest that resume must be only 1 page. But, I can only put few information in my resume so personal website is a good idea to include more project information.</p> <p>So, I created static website before January 2020.</p> <p>Note: I created this website without any cost. Also, I hosted it free on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">github pages</a>. I will create separate blog for this.</p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">University Career & Internship Fair </h2> <p>I attended career fair in the end of the February 2020 at my <a href=\"https://uwm.edu/careerplan/students-2/jobs-internships/career-fairs/\">university</a>. However, I have applied to more than 200 companies for software development positions before career fair.</p> <p>After attending career fair, I was feeling it is worthless because many companies representative don't know anything about the position. They gives business card or page and ask me to apply through online by mentioned website. They are not even interested to take a look at the resume. Many companies do not hire internation students, they are looking for us citizens. But, I went to every companies table and leave my resume.</p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Got Emails from Few Companies</h2> <p>One week passed after attending career fair. I even stopped to apply for new companies because of frustration. I responed to email and scheduled in-person interview with 2 companies. One of that are ABB(I got an email from ABB on Friday March 6th). I went to ABB site office on Tuesday March 10th. </p> <p>The interview went well. I was confident that I will get this job. After 2 days(March 12th), I got an congratulation email from my manager. I was so happy on that day. I like to thanks my manger for trusting on me. Happy ending :)</p> <p><img src=\"/images/blog/ABB-Internship-Offer-logo.png\" alt class=\"img-fluid\" /></p> <p>I did not mention about how I got an in-person interview. As I said earlier, I went to every company table in my university career fair. After one week, ABB's manager emailed me that he got an resume from the HR department and he is looking for intern to complete one project in the summer. So, the university career fair helped me to get an summer internship in my case even I was thinking career fair is worthless.</p> <p>I know that was a long post but this is it, my full experience and journey into getting an offer from ABB. Interviewing is a lot about luck, trust me, but the only thing in your hand is practice and perseverance. I was lucky but prepared. <h4> Goodluck with your journey!</h4></p> ",

         "body": "<h1 class=\"mb-3\"> Is there any way to call external js file function from inside react component? </h1> <h4>The answer is <b>Yes</b>.</h4> <p><img src=\"/images/blog/How-to-call-external-Javascript-file-function-from-react-component-logo.png\" alt class=\"img-fluid\" /></p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Problem Scenario</h2> <p>Case 1: Suppose, you have an index.html file that includes some javascript. Now on your react component, you have a condition that will render only if the condition is true. This means that initially when the page loaded the component has not been rendered yet. When button toggled this is where that component gets rendered. That child component needs to call a javascript method that was included on your external javascript file or inside index.html javascript code. So, how can you do this?</p> <p>Case 2: Your external javascript function calls when the first time you open the website but when react router changes the component it's not calling that function. I have faced this situation to convert my static website to dynamically. The problem was: there is a jquery function that runs on div tags, class, id events. But, in react the page is never refreshed so jquery runs smoothly first time. After routes change it is not execute the function again. So, data was not displayed on my second page due to jquery animation code.</p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Solution</h2> <p>Currently, I'm learning the react by own so I have spent many time to find the solution.</p> <p>Here is the solution. For exaple, you have function inside the index.html file. In that case, you can use componentDidMount function and call that function using window.functionName(). You can check more details about componentDidMount <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount\">here.</a></p> <figure> <figcaption>In index.html</figcaption> <pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt; function test(){ alert('Function from index.html'); } &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> </figure>\n\n<figure> <figcaption>In your component</figcaption> <pre><code>componentDidMount: function(){ window.test(); } </code></pre> </figure> <p> Suppose, you have external javascript file and want to rerun whole code then you have to wrap whole code in one function. Add first and last line from below in your external js file. </p> <pre><code>function globalFunction() { //....your whole javascript file code } </code></pre> <figure> <figcaption>Now in your component</figcaption> <pre><code>componentDidMount: function(){ window.globalFunction(); } </code></pre> </figure> <p> Overall, componentDidMount function execute the code everytime after it rendered, that's the meaning of the function. There are many soluction you can find about onUpdate event in Router tag or onEnter event in route tag. But, these all are the deprected in the react new version. So, follow this to save your precious time. <b>Please check this post date to verify componentDidMount is not deprecated.</b> </p>",

         "description": "The bigger your future, the better your present.",
         "body": "<h1 class=\"mb-3\"> The bigger your future, the better your present. </h1>\n<p>Today's motivation by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy\" alt>Benjamin Hardy </a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-logo.png\" alt class=\"img-fluid\" /></p>\n<p>\n    When you have a specific future you are striving for and committed to, your present circumstances and experiences take on a new meaning. You’re able to convert your experience — even your painful experience — into learning, growth, and change. If you don’t have a future you’re actively striving for, then you can’t actively convert your experience into learning. \n</p>\n<p>\n    When you’re committed to a bigger future, your present becomes far less predictable. Rather than living within the confines of your narrow comfort zone, you begin embracing uncertainty. You begin stepping outside of your “known” world and begin approaching the world of your Future Self.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Below skills can achieve incredible things in your life.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">1. Define Your Future Self (No More Than 3 Years Out)</h2>\n<p>\n    Psychologists call active learning “deliberate practice.” You can’t engage in such “practice” or learning unless you have a very clear goal. You need a clear goal and also a clear future identity, as the person you plan to become.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">2. Start Getting All of the Information You Possibly Can</h2>\n<p>\n    Once you’ve defined your own future self, you need to start getting information. You need to develop a clear goal and plan to become your future self.\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-1.png\" alt class=\"img-fluid\" /></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">3. Tell Everyone About Your Plan</h2>\n<p>\n    It takes courage to be open about your goals. It takes courage to be open about your failings.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Mr. Rogers said: “Anything that’s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.”\n</p>\n<p>\n    It means that when you become more open and honest as a person, life becomes far more manageable. You stop needlessly suffering internally about unfulfilled dreams or former hurts. You move forward. And that’s the freaking key! Moving forward! That’s where we are about here. Moving forward as powerfully and authentically as possible.\n</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">4. Invest at the Level of Your Future Self</h2>\n<p>Investing in yourself, then, is also about your network of relationships. You are only as good as your network. The more successful you become, the more life becomes about “Who” instead of “How.” The worst thing you could do is trying “going it alone” on your goals. Going it alone is a demonstration of a lack of commitment.\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-2.png\" alt class=\"img-fluid\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">5. Eliminate Everything that Discourages Your Future Self</h2>\n<p>\n    Stepping out of the comfort zone of your current persona and subconscious is risky. It involves uncertainty and courage. Given this fact, you need the stability and support of encouraging friends and loved ones.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Beyond relationships, you need to remove the information and experiences that are triggering your current and former selves. Zig Ziglar said, “Your input determines your outlook. Your outlook determines your output, and your output determines your future.”\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">6. Write in Your Journal Every Morning About Your Future Self</h2>\n<p>\n    There’s a lot going on in your world. Taking 10–20 minutes every day, ideally at the start of the day, to express your thoughts and feelings is how you reduce your internal sufferings and make life manageable.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Writing in your goals every day is essential to optimizing your life. If you want the best possible results, write about your goals and dreams every day. When you’re struggling emotions, write about your emotions. By giving them form, you’ll stop suffering and be enabled to move forward.\n</p>\n<p><b>Be incredibly honest with yourself.</b></p>\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">7. Define 1–3 Actions You Can Make Daily Toward Your Goal</h2>\n<p>There is a fundamental difference between urgent and important activities. Life is filled with urgencies. But your future self is in the “important” category. Anything that is “important” can easily be procrastinated and put off. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-3.png\" alt class=\"img-fluid\" /></p>\n<p>\n    When you’re focused on your future self, you don’t need a big to-do list. Instead, you need a focused and short list. Just 1–3 items each day. Count your wins. Make meaningful progress. \n</p>\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">8. “Eat the Frog” Every Single Day</h2>\n<p>\n    If you’re committed to your dreams, make progress on them before you do anything else. Even if that means you must get up early. If you make progress toward your “important” dreams, you’ll be a better person throughout your day. You’ll be happier in your relationships. You’ll have better energy. You’ll be congruent. You’ll be hopeful and happy. You’ll energize others in a powerful way. You’ll get out of your head with feelings of regret. Thus, you’ll be more present.\n</p>\n<p><b>If you eat the frog every morning, you will live your dreams.</b></p>\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">9. Report Your Progress Daily to Your Accountability Partner (This Takes 1 Minute/Day)</h2>\n<p>The above picture turns accountability into a single text message each evening. You report how you did on your Big-3(win/out of all) and list your Big-3 for the next day. There’s an added benefit to listing your Big-3 the night before, and that’s that you get to go to bed with a purpose.</p>\n<p>\n    By going to bed with a purpose, you can wake up motivated and with a plan. This allows you to avoid needless decision fatigue the next morning.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">10. Completely Unplug Every Single Day</h2>\n<p>\n    Last but not least, you need to fully “unplug” for large intervals throughout your day. There’s a lot of research on Psychological detachment from work. True psychological detachment occurs when you completely refrain from work-related activities and thoughts during non-work time.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Research has shown that only 16 percent of respondents reported getting creative insight while at work. Ideas generally came while the person was at home or in transportation, or during recreational activity<b>(Happens with me most of the time)</b>. “The most creative ideas aren’t going to come while sitting in front of your monitor,” says Scott Birnbaum, a vice president of Samsung Semiconductor.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The reason for this is simple. When you’re working directly on a task, your mind is tightly focused on the problem at hand (i.e., direct reflection). Conversely, when you’re not working, your mind loosely wanders (i.e., indirect reflection).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Creativity is a skill you can develop. As is clarity and insight. You’ll get much more when you take time to rest and recover. You need to fully unplug and be actively engaged in other areas of your life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    I wrote this post inspired by Benjamin Hardy's post on Medium.

I went through many tutorials to find perfect programming language to create mobile application. In the end, I was in dilemma between react and flutter. Finally I decided to move on to start learning react native because recently I converted my HTML site to react. </p> <p> Now, it's time to find right tutorial to learn flow, architecture and basics. I looked into youtube, many blogs, official document as well. But, I didn't find any right tutorial. </p> <p> Many tutorials are using the Expo that I don't want to include in my application. Basically, there are two ways to build native application in react. 1) Expo CLI 2) Native CLI </p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Expo vs Native</h2> <p> If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator. </p> <p> If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them. </p> <p> Overall, your final application size will be at least 20 mb using Expo CLI. So, I don't want that. </p> <p> As I have searched many tutorials to create application using Native-CLI but I can't find easily. Because, everyone suggests beginner to start learning using Expo CLI. </p> <p> However, I decided to learn directly Native CLI. Hence, I dig into it more. In the end, I found really good tutorial to create the calculator app. You can start it from <a href=\"https://kylewbanks.com/blog/react-native-tutorial-part-1-hello-react\">here.</a> </p> <p> Also, there is many more tutorials shared by <a href=\"https://github.com/jondot\">Jondot</a> (github user).

One can understand basic architecture, classes, libraries, intallation of react native by creating calculator app. Now, it's time to work on real application.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Application Onboarding</h2>\n<p>\n    First rule of mobile application is user can understand your application features. App onboarding is key for one core reason: if users don’t understand your app, they won’t use it. The onboarding process is a user’s first impression of your app, and when designed correctly, increases the likelihood of successful adoption. When a user launches your app for the first time, the onboarding process reinforces your app’s value and provides instructions that highlight key benefits and features. A strong onboarding process is essential to your app’s success.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I found good tutorial for creating mobile application onboarding. You can find whole tutorial <a href=\"https://rationalappdev.com/complete-guide-to-mobile-app-onboarding-with-react-native/#what-are-we-building\">here</a>. Tutorial is written by Konstantin Shkut.

Github repo link: <a href=\"https://github.com/rationalappdev/onboarding.git\">https://github.com/rationalappdev/onboarding.git</a> By following this tutorial, you will learn how to build an on boarding flow for your app. And you’re not limited to screens with some copy, icons or images. You can also have instructions on how to use your app, input fields, and some other sorts of customization controls. There are various ways of doing onboarding. It’d be a good idea to look at the apps with great onboarding to see what they do and find out what would work the best for your app.\n</p>\n<p> Best wishes to you from KePy :). </p>",

         "body": "<h1 class=\"mb-3\"> Here's the common problems that you might face in react-native </h1> <p> I hope you have just started to learning mobile app development using react native. There are lots of challenges to adopting the new technology. I will write about which issue took my much time to solve. </p> <p><img src=\"/images/blog/problems-for-react-native-beginners-logo.png\" alt class=\"img-fluid\" /></p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Synchronisation Problem</h2> <p> It's not easier to complete the installation of new technology. As you know, developers are keep trying to solve this problem. However, each solution creates the new problem. In react native, you can simply install any new libraries using the npm but there are lots of problem behind this. Developers keep introduces the new features, solve previous bugs, improving architecture etc. </p> <p> In result, they keep update the versions of the libraries and we have to use latest version of the library. But, when you update only one library then it directly affects the other libraries that depended on it. You will find lots of issues about it in the Github. </p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Multiple commands produce</h2> <p> The common problem that everyone faces in the react native is <b>Multiple commands produce</b>. As I was working on <a href=\"#/blog/react-native-tutorial-for-beginners-part-2\">mobile onboarding</a> feature. So, I have to use react-native-vector-icons library to include icons in my project. </p> <p> But, this libary includes fonts library that already comes with react native original libary as well as with other libraies (ex: react-native-base, galio-framework etc). So, when you build your project it clashes with other libray and leads to <b>build fail</b>. </p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Full Error</h2> <p> <figure> <pre><code> error: Multiple commands produce '/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Kopgitv1.app/Entypo.ttf': 1) Target 'Kopgitv1' (project 'Kopgitv1') has copy command from '/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/node_modules/native-base/Fonts/Entypo.ttf' to '/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Kopgitv1.app/Entypo.ttf' 2) Target 'Kopgitv1' (project 'Kopgitv1') has copy command from '/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/Entypo.ttf' to '/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Kopgitv1.app/Entypo.ttf'</code></pre> </figure> </p> <p> I almost spent one day to solve this problem. I have reinstalled all the libraries many times to catch the original problem. For that, I have created whole new project from the scratch and caught the issue. After that, I was looking for the solution. Many tutorials are said to unlink react-native-vector-icons library but still it's only a quick fix. I got many github and stackoverflow issue links but still no solution worked. </p> <p> Finally, one article from gitmemory saved me. There solution worked for me. You can check whole post <a href=\"https://gitmemory.com/issue/facebook/react-native/20492/557944837\">here.</a> However, I'm attaching solution if you can't read the post. </p> <p> <figure><pre><code> For newbies like me: you need to edit the file &amp;lt;PROJECT_FOLDER&amp;gt;/ios/&amp;lt;PROJECT_NAME&amp;gt;.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj Then comment out the font lines (files ending in .ttf) like this: inputPaths = ( \"${PODS_ROOT}/Target Support Files/Pods-drawer2/Pods-drawer2-resources.sh\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/AntDesign.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/Entypo.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/EvilIcons.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/Feather.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/FontAwesome.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/FontAwesome5_Brands.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/FontAwesome5_Regular.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/FontAwesome5_Solid.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/Fontisto.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/Foundation.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/Ionicons.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/MaterialCommunityIcons.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/MaterialIcons.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/Octicons.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/SimpleLineIcons.ttf\", // \"${PODS_ROOT}/../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/Zocial.ttf\", ); name = \"[CP] Copy Pods Resources\"; outputPaths = ( // </code></pre> </figure> </p> <p> If this still don't work for you, you can check following tutorials that have best solution that worked for the most. </p> <p> <a href=\"https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/issues/1074\">1) [Xcode 11] 'Multiple commands produce' error when building with new Xcode build system</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50718018/xcode-10-error-multiple-commands-produce\">2) Xcode 10 Error: Multiple commands produce </a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/20492\">3) 'Multiple commands produce' error when building with new Xcode build system</a> </p> <p>Hope this article helped you.

         "body": "<h1 class=\"mb-3\"> Understanding AsyncStorage, Redux: Why and How it can be used in React-Native? </h1> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Why Redux?</h2> <p> First, we have to understand why redux is needed in our application. Recently, I completed mobile onboarding application. After that, user moved to the homepage. However, when user refreshed the application; mobile onboarding screens again shown to the user. The purpose of mobile onboarding screen to show main features of the application to the user---This should be one time only--. </p> <p><img src=\"/images/blog/react-redux-guide-for-beginners-logo.png\" alt class=\"img-fluid\" /></p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">AsyncStorage</h2> <p> As you know, react native manages state data component wise and you need to store boolean flag (ex. userOnboardingCompleted?) to create condition on mobile onboarding screens. So, I looked for the local storage and found well known library \"AsyncStorage\" for react-native. This thing worked for me. <b>Do not use react-native core component for that as it is deprecated in new versions.</b> Follow this tutorial to start with <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage\">AsyncStorage</a> and trust me it is very easy part. </p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Redux</h2> <p> Now, I want to use apiToken in every component. You might be thinking: it is easy to get values from the local storage using AsyncStorage getItem function. But, it is bad designing because everytime your application fetch value from the storage so it takes much time to render new pages. </p> <p> This time redux come into the picture. Redux is a state manager. In other way, it is state management libraries beautifully keep logic and behaviours abstracted away from the UI. So, your application reads local storage data one time and stores it into the memory using state. Now, redux passes this data to every component so it will save lot of time. </p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Challenges</h2> <p> Learning redux is quite difficult as you have to learn many new things. When I approached Redux for the first time today I was confused. There is too much terminology: action, reducer, middleware. But on top of that it wasn't clear to me how were all the moving parts glued together? There were some minions or what? In Redux there are no minions (unfortunately). </p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Solution</h2> <p> However, it is not that hard if you follow this tutorial completely. </p> <p> <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/understanding-how-reducers-are-used-in-redux/\">1) https://css-tricks.com/understanding-how-reducers-are-used-in-redux/</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcC8KZ_Ga2M\">2) #1 WTF is Redux? | React Native App | Redux Tutorial</a> </p> <p> Above two tutorials are enough to understand the react redux but you have to do practice together and understand concept thouroughly. </p> <p>Thanks for reading and stay tuned on this blog! Happy coding!!!!!</p>",

         "body": "<h1 class=\"mb-3\"> Time saver library to manage redux state data locally. </h1> <p> Redux is a great library which solves many issues related to keeping a state of an application. Thanks to it, we no longer have to worry about the hierarchy of components. The central store can be accessed from every component to get the current state of any aspect of an application. </p> <p><img src=\"/images/blog/how-to-persist-redux-state-to-the-local-storage-logo.png\" alt class=\"img-fluid\" /></p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Local Storage</h2> <p> However, sometimes you may need to store redux state data locally. For ex, storing user profile name, user name can be used multiple components. As per current understanding, you will read and write profile name from local storage--AsyncStorage--. </p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Redux-Persist</h2> <p> But, you can do this using redux persist library. Redux-persist is a simple library; it’s a wrapper for a store that automatically saves a redux state to the storage. Also, you can define where it should save data, and available options depend on a platform; you can choose localStorage, sessionStorage, localForage, AsyncStorage or we can even integrate it with the custom storage. In future, if you want to change local storage then you have to <b>change in only one file.</b> </p> <p> There are many configuration you can give to the library and it makes your life very easy. Suppose, you don't want to store every data in the local storage. So, there is a option to provide <b>whitelist</b> and <b>blacklist</b> components. Blacklist components navigation will not be persisted--oppose to whitelist--. </p> <h2 class=\"mb-3 mt-5\">Tutorial</h2> <p> If you think, it is useful in your application. You can follow below tutorials to get complete understanding about redux persist. </p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3aJNTqeXMw\">React Native Redux Persist [ How to use redux persist ]</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://blog.reactnativecoach.com/the-definitive-guide-to-redux-persist-84738167975\">The Definitive Guide to Redux Persist</a> </p> <p> I followed above two tutorials first time to get started with redux persist library. Now, you don't have to communicate to local storage directly. </p> <p>Thanks for reading and stay tuned on this blog! Happy coding!!!!!</p>",
