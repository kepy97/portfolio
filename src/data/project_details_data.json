At that time, we have to go to the GTU website\n        frequently to check semester result declared or not. So, I came up with the idea to create result notifier that\n        sends a notification to students when their result declared on site. This application keep track of previous\n        declared results and send notification to registered students when new result declare.\n    </p>\n</li>\n<div class=\"tecser\">\n    <div><b>Technology &amp; Services:</b></div>\n    <div>Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, AWS, Way2SMS, Gmail </div>\n</div>\n<li>\n    <div class=\"icons-left\"><i class=\"fas fa-circle\"></i></div>\n    <div class=\"content-right\"> Used python web scraping library to get content of the websites.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n    <div class=\"icons-left\"><i class=\"fas fa-circle\"></i></div>\n    <div class=\"content-right\"> Hosted python script on amazon AWS and it continuously sends request to our result site\n        24x7. </div>\n</li>\n<li>\n    <div class=\"icons-left\"><i class=\"fas fa-circle\"></i></div>\n    <div class=\"content-right\"> Created web form for other students to register their details. </div>\n</li>\n<li>\n    <div class=\"icons-left\"><i class=\"fas fa-circle\"></i></div>\n    <div class=\"content-right\"> When the new result was declared, registered students get SMS and email notification.\n    </div>\n</li>\n<li>\n    <div class=\"icons-left\"><i class=\"fas fa-circle\"></i></div>\n    <div class=\"content-right\"> Used <a href=\"https://www.way2sms.com/\">way2sms</a> and Gmail services to send\n        notification.</div>\n</li>"

The motto behind this project is sometimes the patient has to wait in a critical\n        situation at hospital/clinic.
