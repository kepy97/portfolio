In fact, <span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\"> international student even can\'t get phone interview so getting a video or in-person interview is a big achievement.</span> In this post, I have written my whole internship hunting experience. </p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"> <img src=\\"/images/blog/ABB-Internship-Offer-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"> </div> <p> I\'m a graduate student at the <a href=\\"https://uwm.edu\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>. I enrolled in Fall-2019. In the starting of November 2019, I started to apply for the internship application. Big companies already started to hire interns. I show many student posts about they got the offer for the Summer 2020 internship. I was feeling nervous because I\'m getting only online coding challenges. It was a bad time for me. </p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">Created Personal Website</p> <p> I started wondering about what is wrong in my application. And I figured out it\'s because I\'m on an F-1 visa. <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\"> Companies are looking for long-term players only</span> and they have to pay extra money for sponsorship. That\'s the main problem. </p> <p> I need to do something different than other applications so I thought I should create my portfolio. Many people suggest that resume must be only 1 page. But, I can only put a few information in my resume so a personal website is a good idea to include more project information. <span class=\\"blog-content-italic\\">So, I created a static website before January 2020.</span> </p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\"> University Career & Internship Fair </p> <p> I attended a career fair at my university in the end of February 2020. However, I have applied to more than <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">200 companies</span> for software development positions before the career fair. </p> <p> After attending a career fair, I was feeling it is worthless because many companies representative doesn\'t know anything about the position. They were giving a business card or page and ask me to apply through online by a mentioned website. They were not even interested to take a look at the resume. Many companies do not hire international students, they were looking for US citizens. <span class=\\"blog-content-italic blog-content-bold\\">But, I decided to go to every companies table and leave my resume. If they don\'t ask for my resume, I insisted them to keep my resume.</span> </p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\"> Luck? </p> <p> I was getting many rejection emails and few of them are instant emails after submitting the application. I think that\'s an auto-generated email where if applicant select as not US citizen, he/she will get an email. One week passed after attending a career fair. Nothing was working out. So, I even stopped to apply for new companies because of frustration. </p> <p> However, I got some good emails among them. I responded to those emails and scheduled an in-person interview with 2 companies. <span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\"> One of them was ABB(I got an email from ABB on Friday, March 6th). I went to the ABB site in Wisconsin office on Tuesday, March 10th for interview.</span> </p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p> The interview went well. I was confident that I will get this job. After 2 days(March 12th), I got a congratulation email from my manager. I was so happy on that day. I like to thanks my manger for trusting me and giving me a chance. Happy ending :) </p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\"> How did they got my resume? </p> <p> I did not mention about how I got an in-person interview.

Now on your react component, you have a condition that will render only if the condition is true. This means that initially when the page loaded the component has not been rendered yet. When button toggled this is where that component gets rendered. That child component needs to call a javascript method that was included on your external javascript file or inside index.html javascript code. So, how can you do this?</p> <p><span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">Case 2:</span> Your external javascript function calls when the first time you open the website but when react router changes the component it\'s not calling that function. <span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\">I have faced this situation to convert my static website to dynamically.</span> The problem was: there is a jquery function that runs on div tags, class, id events. But, in react the page is never refreshed so jquery runs smoothly first time. After routes change it is not execute the function again. So, data was not displayed on my second page due to jquery animation code.</p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Solution</h2> <p>Currently, I\'m learning the react by own so I have spent many time to find the solution.</p> <p>Here is the solution. For exaple, you have function inside the index.html file. In that case, you can use componentDidMount function and call that function using window.functionName(). You can check more details about componentDidMount <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">here.</a></p> <figure> <figcaption>In index.html</figcaption> <pre><code>&lt;script type=\\"text/javascript\\"&gt;\\nfunction test() { \\n\\talert(\'Function from index.html\');\\n}\\n&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> </figure>\\n\\n<figure> <figcaption>In your component</figcaption> <pre><code>componentDidMount() {\\n    window.test();\\n}</code></pre> </figure> <p> Suppose, you have external javascript file and want to rerun whole code then you have to wrap whole code in one function. Add first and last line from below in your external js file. </p> <pre><code>function globalFunction() { \\n    //....your whole javascript file code \\n} </code></pre> <figure> <figcaption>Now in your component</figcaption> <pre><code>componentDidMount() {\\n    window.globalFunction();\\n}</code></pre> </figure> <p> Overall, componentDidMount function execute the code everytime after it rendered, that\'s the meaning of the function. There are many soluction you can find about onUpdate event in Router tag or onEnter event in route tag. But, these all are the deprected in the react new version. So, follow this to save your precious time. <b>Please check this post date to verify componentDidMount is not deprecated.</b> </p>","published":true,"created":"2020-04-30T03:25:50.844Z","updated":"2020-04-30T03:25:50.844Z"},{"id":4,"title":"On my way to build mobile application","url":"On-my-way-to-build-mobile-application","tags":["react-native"],"image":"blog/On-my-way-to-build-mobile-application-logo.png","description":"Stepping into mobile application development","body":"<div> <h1 class=\\"mt-5 blog-title\\">Learning to build mobile applications</h1> <p class=\\"blog-desc\\">Stepping into mobile application development</p> <p>I\'ve always wanted to create mobile applications but I didn\'t get much time to learn new programming languages and create some really cool app. </p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"><img src=\\"/images/blog/On-my-way-to-build-mobile-application-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"></div> <p> Today, I was able to complete submissions for two of my classes so I don\'t have to worry about it.

Recently, I completed a mobile onboarding application. After that, the user moved to the homepage. However, when the user refreshed the application, mobile onboarding screens were again shown to the user. The purpose of the mobile onboarding screen is to show the main features of the application to the user---<span class=\\"blog-content-italic\\">This should be one time only</span>--.</p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"><img src=\\"/images/blog/react-redux-guide-for-beginners-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"></div> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">AsyncStorage</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p>As you know, react-native manages state data component-wise so you need to store a boolean flag (ex. userOnboardingCompleted?) to create a condition on mobile onboarding screens. So, I looked for the local storage and found a well-known library <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">AsyncStorage</span> for react-native. This thing worked for me. <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">Remember not to use the react-native core component for that as it is deprecated in new versions.</span> Follow this <a href=\\"https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">tutorial</a> to start with AsyncStorage and trust me it\'s easy.</p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">Redux</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p>Now, I want to use <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">apiToken</span> in every component. You might be thinking: it is easy to get values from the local storage using AsyncStorage <span class=\\"blog-content-inline\\">getItem</span> function. But, it is unhealthy designing because every time your application fetches the value from the storage, so it takes much time to render new pages. This time redux comes into the picture. <span class=\\"blog-content-italic\\">Redux is a state manager. In another way, it is state management libraries beautifully keep logic and behaviors abstracted away from the UI.</span> So, your application reads local storage data one time and stores it into the memory using state. Now, redux passes this data to every component so it will save time. </p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">Challenges</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p>Learning redux is quite tasking as you have to learn many new things. When I approached Redux today, for the first time, I was confused. There is too much terminology: action, reducer, middleware. <span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\">But on top of that, it wasn\'t clear to me how we\'re all the moving parts glued together?</span> There were some minions or what?

Now create function that handles the scrolling.\\n</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <pre><code>handleScrolling() {\\n        ref.current.scrollIntoView({\\nbehavior: \'smooth\',\\n            block: \'start\',\\n        });\\n    }</code></pre>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n    Next, you just have to call this function and it will smoothly scroll to the section. For ex, I want to scroll when user clicks on the button so code will look like this:\\n</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <pre><code>&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;\\n        Scroll Into View\\n      &lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n    Now, your scrolling works fine. So how does this work? Let\'s get into the details: In order to scroll to the section, we added a button element with a onClick handler. Also section receives a ref object for accessing the DOM node later. Then in the click handler of the button, we can use the reference of the DOM node to use the scrollIntoView API. In our case, we are using a configuration object to make it a smooth scroll to the start of the list item.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Still any doubt or want to create multiple reference, checkout <a href=\\"https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-scroll-to-item\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">this</a> really cool tutorial by Robin that will help you. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If you want to test it, checkout the <a href=\\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/the-road-to-learn-react/react-list-component/tree/master/?fontsize=14&file=/src/components/ListScrollToItemOutside.js:1168-1179\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Demo on codesandbox.</a>\\n</p>","published":true,"created":"2020-05-21T06:03:11.650Z","updated":"2020-05-21T06:03:11.650Z"},{"id":16,"title":"Strangest bug that I never thought about it","url":"strangest-bug-that-i-never-thought-about-it","tags":["react","bug"],"image":"blog/strangest-bug-that-i-never-thought-about-it-logo.png","description":"Apple thinks and works differently.

So, the issue was when I shot a picture holding the iPhone vertically, the image gets saved on the iPhone. When I viewed it on iPhone or mac pc, it showed up appropriately in portrait view, but when I uploaded it to my web application it was turning into a landscape view with the wrong orientation.</p> <p>I have uploaded to my blog post: <a href=\\"/blog/feelings-after-writing-final-exams\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Feelings after writing final exams.</a> So, I took a photo from my iPhone and uploaded it to my website. After posting it, I checked it on my laptop. At that time, the post was looking good. Check out the image below:</p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"> <img src=\\"/images/blog/strangest-bug-that-i-never-thought-about-it-1.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"> </div> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">After some days</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p>One of my friends was checking my posts and he said one of the image is not showing properly. I again looked into my laptop and it was showing perfectly. But, when he said he is checking in the iPhone so I looked into it and found this:</p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"> <img src=\\"/images/blog/strangest-bug-that-i-never-thought-about-it-2.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"> </div> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">Actual Problem: EXIF</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p><span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\">EXIF is a format in which pictures metadata can be found</span>. These metadata may include information including the device used for capturing like (iPhone 7, Samsung S4), camera specifications, GPS coordinates, orientation, e.t.c.</p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">How devices typically take pictures</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p>Typically if a device takes a photo, it uses its sensors to rotate the image to the right orientation.

It expects the software used for viewing to rotate the image taken to correct orientation.</span></p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">Why does it do so?</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p>hmm\u2026 maybe to save battery in iphone, or maybe it will cause a sight delay to save the image.</p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">What now?</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p>As you are thinking, this is the problem with iPhone which is not in Android or Laptop. To fix this issue, you have to use a library that transforms the image. Here I found the github ticker <a href=\\"https://github.com/mosch/react-avatar-editor/issues/123\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">The image is rotated in iPhone</a>.</p> <p>You can use this javascript library to fix this issue: <a href=\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/fix-image-rotation\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">fix-image-rotation</a>.

I read many articles regarding database design. So, I want to list out a few important rules that are different from the common rules.</p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"> <img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"> </div> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">Nature of the application (OLTP or OLAP)</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p><span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\">When you start your database design the first thing to analyze is the nature of the application you are designing for</span>, is it Transactional or Analytical.</p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-sub-title\\">Transactional</p> <p>In this kind of application, your end-user is more interested in CRUD, i.e., creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

These kinds of databases have a less number of inserts and updates. The main intention here is to fetch and analyze data as fast as possible. The official name for such a kind of database is OLAP.</p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"> <img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-1.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"> </div> <p>In other words, if you think inserts, updates, and deletes are more prominent, then go for normalized table design, else create a flat denormalized database structure. Follow this: <a href=\\"https://www.studytonight.com/dbms/database-normalization.php\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Normalization of Database</a></p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">Naming Convention</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p>A naming convention is an integral part of a well-built data model. Look at the database model below. The model is not very fun to look at, to try to understand or to code around.</p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"> <img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-2.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"> </div> <p>Let\u2019s start with some things that you should consider if you need to create a new naming convention. You want to give a name that follows across the whole database.</p> <p class=\\"list-title\\">The case of the name. You can choose between: </p> <ul class=\\"bullet-list\\"> <li>UPPERCASE names - All names in uppercase</li> <li>lowercase names - All names in lowercase</li> <li>camelCase names \u2013 the name starts with a lowercase letter, but new words start with an uppercase letter</li> <li>PascalCaseNames (also known as upper camel) \u2013 similar to camelCase, but the name starts with an uppercase letter, as do all additional words</li> <li>Underscore - you can separate them with an underscore (like_this)</li> </ul> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">Data types</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p>We deal with different types of data such as strings, characters, whole numbers (integers), and decimal numbers (floating-point numbers). Similarly, when we write a computer program to process different types of data, we need to specify its type.</p> <p class=\\"list-title\\">PostgreSQL supports many data types. Here, I list out few points to choose data type:</p> <ul class=\\"bullet-list\\"> <li>Choose BIGINT for primary ID. Many developer face issues to convert INTEGER to BIGINT later on.</li> <li>Store all timestamps using UTC.</li> <li>Always use a library to perform date and time math.</li> <li>Use a standard time offset</li> </ul> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">Break data into logical pieces</p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p>This rule is actually the first rule from 1st normal form. Better approach would be to break table field into further logical pieces so that we can write clean and optimal queries.</p> <p>However, I want to add here. <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">Break data into logical pieces but don\'t overdose it</span>.</p> <p><span class=\\"blog-content-italic blog-content-highlight\\">Developers are cute creatures. If you tell them this is the way, they keep doing it;</span> well, they overdo it leading to unwanted consequences. For example: you can see the phone number field; it\u2019s rare that you will operate on ISD codes of phone numbers separately (until your application demands it). So it would be a wise decision to just leave it as it can lead to more complications.</p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"> <img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-3.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"> </div> <p class=\\"list-title\\">PostgreSQL supports many data types.

Also, there\'s a Flask library (<a href=\\"https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Flask-SQLAlchemy</a>) which is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy to the application. So, SQLAlchemy is much simpler to use in Flask.</p> <p>Before you start using it, you need to understand some basic topics to work with Flask-SQLAlchemy.</p> <ul class=\\"bullet-list\\"> <li> <p class=\\"list-title\\"><a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Data Models</a></p> <p>This is the important concept of ORM to start working with it. You need to understand how to define your database models in your program.</p> </li> <li> <p class=\\"list-title\\">Relationships</p> <p>In a larger applications, there will be multiple relationships in the database design. So, you have to tell your program that these tables are connected with each other.</p> </li> <li> <p class=\\"list-title\\">Relationship links</p> <p>To connect different database fields, you need to specify links between them in the program. There are two concepts known as backref and back_populate in SQLAlchemy. <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">back_populates</span> informs each relationship about the other so that they are kept in sync. So, you need to use in Parent and child class as well. If you use <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">backref</span>, it needs to go on one of them only.</p> </li> <li> <p class=\\"list-title\\">Join Type</p> <p>After defining the relationships between your data models, you need to specify how to join them when getting the data from those models. There are multiple types of joining in SQLAlchemy like: select, dynamic, joined, subquery etc. Each of those have different meanings, you have to figure out how you need your data.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The four concepts above are extremely important before you start using the SQLAlchemy.

In above example, <span class=\\"blog-content-inline\\">this.handleClick.bind(this)</span> function is binding the key this to the function in the context of the React Component.

If I made changes in the database, many APIs need to update so <span class=\\"blog-content-italic\\">there\'ll be changes in models, endpoints, controllers, services, and many more.</span> </p> <p class=\\"blog-desc-title\\"> Deadline issue </p> <p> Also, the deadline was coming up in a few days. So, I have to deliver the project at that time. </p> <p class=\\"list-title\\">I had two ways:</p> <ul class=\\"number-list\\"> <li>Go with the current plan</li> <li>Make a big change.</li> </ul> <p> If I go with the first way, I can deliver a project on time. But, there\'ll be a performance issue in the project. Also, when a project grows this kind of problem always hurts. <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\"> So, I went with a second way.</span> I deleted the database table and changed all APIs. Also, I have to change the frontend logic. </p> <p class=\\"blog-desc-title\\"> Victory </p> <p> <span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\">It took many nights and many hours to change that.</span> Also, I delivered my project on the time. After the changes, I felt satisfied and much more happy. When it comes to positive changes, the human brain is still challenged to do something differently. I learned so many things from the change. <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">Also, many pending things became so easy to incorporate in the project. That saved my time.</span> I know this post is kind of messy. I can\'t post whole detail about the problem. Sorry about that. </p>\\n\\n <p class=\\"summary-text\\"> In summary, change is not only inevitable, it can lead to beautiful opportunities, even when they come from the deepest wells of pain and loss. When we greet uncertainty and the unknown with self-care, self-love, and support, we find new ways and our brain finds way to a future that holds many new adventures. <span class=\\"blog-content-bold blog-content-italic\\">Go with the flow.</span> </p> </div>","published":true,"created":"2020-08-15T17:09:02.682Z","updated":"2020-08-15T17:09:02.682Z"},{"id":36,"title":"My Personal Visual Studio Code Setup","url":"my-personal-visual-studio-code-setup","tags":["tutorial"],"image":"blog/my-personal-visual-studio-code-setup-logo.png","description":"KePy style using of Visual Studio Code.","body":"<div> <h1 class=\\"mt-5 blog-title\\">My Personal Visual Studio Code Setup</h1> <p class=\\"blog-desc\\">KePy style using of Visual Studio Code.</p> <p> I love the text editor setup I\'ve been using for the past year and a half, so I want to show off my setup! <span class=\\"blog-content-italic\\">Visual Studio Code has far surpassed my experiences with other editors which I used for the years before it.</span> I thought I would do a quick write up on my setup and the extensions I love! </p> <p> <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">Its been a while since I moved to Visual Studio Code for every programming language</span> and it has been a great experience. Visual Studio Code is not the same as the full Visual Studio, that Microsoft is well-known for. It is an excellent editor with a plugin ecosystem for most languages and tools. Install the right plugins and you are good to Go :-) </p> <p class=\\"blog-desc-title\\"> Below are my recommendations: </p> <p class=\\"blog-desc-sub-title\\"> 1) Theme </p> <p> Since I write many posts about how to code professionally and give a lot of talks on programming, having a readable theme is super important to me. I also love to have a theme that I enjoy aesthetically, so usually something with a lot of girly colours. My all-time favourite theme is <a href=\\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Dracula.</a> </p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"> <img src=\\"/images/blog/my-personal-visual-studio-code-setup-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"> </div> <p class=\\"blog-desc-sub-title\\"> 2) Icon Theme </p> <p> As a software developer, we have to work with different types of extension files. So, there\'s a theme in VS Code marketplace that I loved it to use it. <a href=\\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Material Icon Theme</a> supports different file extension icons as well as folder icons. You can also use custom icons to the files/folders. </p> <p class=\\"blog-desc-sub-title\\"> 3) Saving Configuration </p> <p> Another key piece of my setup is my save configuration. Many developers are using autosave code. In that case, your code automatically saved after some delay. However, I don\'t like to use that because I\'m a person who keeps uses <span class=\\"blog-content-inline\\">ctrl + s</span> button whenever I feel satisfied with the current code. If you want you can follow this <a href=\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_save-auto-save\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">article</a> steps to enable it. </p> <p> Most importantly you would like to auto-format your code. So, your code always looks pretty and easy to readable. I\'m using this feature on format code on Save and format code on Paste. Now, whenever you save the file or paste code from another file it will be autoformatted. You have to specify it in <span class=\\"blog-content-inline\\">setting.json</span> file. Follow this article steps: <a href=\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Formatting</a> </p> <p class=\\"blog-desc-sub-title\\"> 4) Programming Errors </p> <p> Above are the general feature that you can use it for any programming language. Now, many time we make programming errors. It can be typing mistake or import module error. There are many extension that you can download for your programming language and it will identify error for you before you run the code. In python, I\'m using pylint to check syntactical and stylistic problems. <a href=\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">(Linting Python in Visual Studio Code)</a> </p> <p class=\\"blog-desc-sub-title\\"> 5) Snippets </p> <p> Again, you need to find a specific extension to use this feature. I\'m sure you\'re using <span class=\\"blog-content-inline\\">ctrl + space</span> button to auto-complete the line/code. So, code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements. There are a bunch of extensions that can support this feature in VS Code in your programming language. For python, you can find <a href=\\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Python by Microsoft</a> extension in the marketplace. </p> <p class=\\"blog-desc-sub-title\\"> 6) GitLens </p> <p> Last but not the least, GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. If you are working with other developers, you might be using <a href=\\"https://github.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Github</a>, <a href=\\"https://bitbucket.org/product\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Bitbucket</a>, <a href=\\"https://about.gitlab.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">GitLab</a> or any other version control tool. <a href=\\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">GitLens</a> helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more. </p> <p class=\\"summary-text\\"> <span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\">Above are my personal recommendations. Hope at least one of those you find it helpful.</span> I suggest you to spend some time on the configuration of your IDE as you will be working at least 8 hours on that every day. It should be configured as you need so you can work more effectively. Happy Hacking :) </p> </div>","published":true,"created":"2020-08-20T12:29:18.198Z","updated":"2020-08-20T12:29:18.198Z"},{"id":37,"title":"Performance Improvement in Project","url":"performance-improvement-in-project","tags":["ABB","internship","Project-Planning","Python-Flask","React"],"image":"blog/performance-improvement-in-project-logo.png","description":"Find out how to improve your project performance significantly.","body":"<div> <h1 class=\\"mt-5 blog-title\\">Performance Improvement in Project</h1> <p class=\\"blog-desc\\">Find out how to improve your project performance significantly</p> <p>Recently, I got some time from the new development of the project. So, I thought let\'s take a look to improve the performance of the project.</p> <p class=\\"blog-desc-title\\"> How to improve? </p> <p> There are several ways to improve the performance of your project. Like? You can start first from <span class=\\"blog-content-bold blog-content-italic\\">cleaning up code, removing unnecessary imports in the file, deleting not needed files.</span> Also, you can reorganize your project structure by dividing into multiple components. </p> <p> Above are the very basic things that you can do in your project. After that, you can take a look at your application main section which is used many times when the user opens the application. This is the section which executes several times. It can be a homepage of your application. <span class=\\"blog-content-italic\\">If there are multiple loops are running, try to remove that first.</span> </p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"> <img src=\\"/images/blog/performance-improvement-in-project-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"> </div> <p class=\\"blog-desc-title\\"> Loops? </p> <p> Yes, loops (like \\"For\\" and \\"While\\" loop) downgrade your application performance. You can move that loop code from backend to front-end or get specifically formatted data from the database. <span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\">Always, try to avoid using loops in the backend except there\'s not any other way.</span> </p> <p class=\\"blog-desc-title\\"> What next? </p> <p> By following above steps, your application will be significantly improved. Now, you can focus on database part. </p> <p> In the software application, <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">major performance is based on the backend and the database.</span> You must be using ORM in the backend to interact with your database and get or insert the data. You can find many guidelines about how to improve performance in your ORM library. I\'m using <a href=\\"https://www.kepy.online/blog/sqlalchemy-tips-for-flask-database-connection\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"></a> in python flask framework. Also, I found a pretty good article about <a href=\\"https://blog.theodo.com/2020/03/sqlalchemy-relationship-performance/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Master SQLAlchemy Relationships in a Performance Friendly Way.</a> </p> <p class=\\"list-title\\"> If you can\'t find anything there are some basic database rules that you can <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">avoid</span> like:</p> <ul class=\\"bullet-list\\"> <li>Retrieving an entire result set when only the count is needed</li> <li>Retrieving entire models when only a few columns are needed</li> <li>Updating one object at a time inside a loop</li> <li>Triggering cascading deletes</li> <li>Using the ORM for a bulk record import</li> <li>Calling commit or flush multiple times</li> </ul> <p class=\\"summary-text\\"> <span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\">I\'ve followed above all rules in my project. Now, performance is drastically changed.</span> I hope above list of common pitfalls can help you avoid these issues and keep your application running smoothly. As always, when diagnosing a performance problem, measurement is key. Most databases offer performance diagnostics that can help you pinpoint issues, such as the PostgreSQL pg_stat_statements module. </p> </div>","published":true,"created":"2020-08-26T07:38:02.682Z","updated":"2020-08-26T07:38:02.682Z"},{"id":38,"title":"Why I changed Github Pages to Netlify Hosting Platform","url":"why-i-changed-github-pages-to-netlify-hosting-platform","tags":["react","github-pages","netlify","SEO"],"image":"blog/why-i-changed-github-pages-to-netlify-hosting-platform-logo.png","description":"Today, I changed this blog hosting from Github pages to Netlify plateform.","body":"<div> <h1 class=\\"mt-5 blog-title\\">Why I changed Github Pages to Netlify Hosting Platform?</h1> <p class=\\"blog-desc\\">Today, I changed this blog hosting from Github pages to Netlify plateform</p> <p> Earlier, I wrote the tutorial about <a href=\\"http://www.kepy.online/blog/hosting-react-blog-to-github-pages\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">How to deploy React App to GitHub Pages?</a> The hosting platform of Github is awesome.
