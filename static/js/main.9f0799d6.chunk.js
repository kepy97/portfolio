In fact, international student even can\'t get phone interview so getting a video or in-person interview is a big achievement. In this post, I will write whole internship hunting experience.</p> <p>I\'m a graduate student at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. I enrolled in fall 2019. In starting of November 2019, I started to apply for the internship application. Big companies already started to hire interns. I show many student post about they got the offer for Summer 2020 internship. I was feeling nervous because I\'m getting only online coding challenges. It was bad time for me..</p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Created Personal Website</h2> <p>I started wondering about what is wrong in my application. And I figured out it\'s because I\'m on F-1 visa. Companies are looking for long-term players only and they have to pay extra money for sponserships. That\'s the main problem.</p> <p>I need to do something different than other applications so I thought I should create my portfolio. Many people suggest that resume must be only 1 page. But, I can only put few information in my resume so personal website is a good idea to include more project information.</p> <p>So, I created static website before January 2020.</p> <p>Note: I created this website without any cost. Also, I hosted it free on <a href=\\"https://pages.github.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">github pages</a>. I will create separate blog for this.</p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">University Career & Internship Fair </h2> <p>I attended career fair in the end of the February 2020 at my <a href=\\"https://uwm.edu/careerplan/students-2/jobs-internships/career-fairs/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">university</a>. However, I have applied to more than 200 companies for software development positions before career fair.</p> <p>After attending career fair, I was feeling it is worthless because many companies representative don\'t know anything about the position. They gives business card or page and ask me to apply through online by mentioned website. They are not even interested to take a look at the resume. Many companies do not hire internation students, they are looking for us citizens. But, I went to every companies table and leave my resume.</p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Got Emails from Few Companies</h2> <p>One week passed after attending career fair. I even stopped to apply for new companies because of frustration. I responed to email and scheduled in-person interview with 2 companies. One of that are ABB(I got an email from ABB on Friday March 6th). I went to ABB site office on Tuesday March 10th. </p> <p>The interview went well. I was confident that I will get this job. After 2 days(March 12th), I got an congratulation email from my manager. I was so happy on that day. I like to thanks my manger for trusting on me. Happy ending :)</p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/ABB-Internship-Offer-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p>I did not mention about how I got an in-person interview. As I said earlier, I went to every company table in my university career fair. After one week, ABB\'s manager emailed me that he got an resume from the HR department and he is looking for intern to complete one project in the summer. So, the university career fair helped me to get an summer internship in my case even I was thinking career fair is worthless.</p> <p>I know that was a long post but this is it, my full experience and journey into getting an offer from ABB. Interviewing is a lot about luck, trust me, but the only thing in your hand is practice and perseverance. I was lucky but prepared. <h4> Goodluck with your journey!</h4></p> ","published":false,"created":"2020-04-23T20:14:14.689Z","updated":"2020-04-23T20:14:14.689Z"},{"id":3,"title":"How to call external Javascript file function from react component","url":"How-to-call-external-Javascript-file-function-from-react-component","tags":["react","javascript"],"image":"blog/How-to-call-external-Javascript-file-function-from-react-component-logo.png","description":"Is there any way to call external js file function from inside react component?","body":"<h1 class=\\"mb-3\\"> Is there any way to call external js file function from inside react component? </h1> <h4>The answer is <b>Yes</b>.</h4> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/How-to-call-external-Javascript-file-function-from-react-component-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Problem Scenario</h2> <p>Case 1: Suppose, you have an index.html file that includes some javascript. Now on your react component, you have a condition that will render only if the condition is true. This means that initially when the page loaded the component has not been rendered yet. When button toggled this is where that component gets rendered. That child component needs to call a javascript method that was included on your external javascript file or inside index.html javascript code. So, how can you do this?</p> <p>Case 2: Your external javascript function calls when the first time you open the website but when react router changes the component it\'s not calling that function. I have faced this situation to convert my static website to dynamically. The problem was: there is a jquery function that runs on div tags, class, id events. But, in react the page is never refreshed so jquery runs smoothly first time. After routes change it is not execute the function again. So, data was not displayed on my second page due to jquery animation code.</p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Solution</h2> <p>Currently, I\'m learning the react by own so I have spent many time to find the solution.</p> <p>Here is the solution. For exaple, you have function inside the index.html file. In that case, you can use componentDidMount function and call that function using window.functionName(). You can check more details about componentDidMount <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">here.</a></p> <figure> <figcaption>In index.html</figcaption> <pre><code>&lt;script type=\\"text/javascript\\"&gt;\\nfunction test() { \\n\\talert(\'Function from index.html\');\\n}\\n&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> </figure>\\n\\n<figure> <figcaption>In your component</figcaption> <pre><code>componentDidMount() {\\n    window.test();\\n}</code></pre> </figure> <p> Suppose, you have external javascript file and want to rerun whole code then you have to wrap whole code in one function. Add first and last line from below in your external js file. </p> <pre><code>function globalFunction() { \\n    //....your whole javascript file code \\n} </code></pre> <figure> <figcaption>Now in your component</figcaption> <pre><code>componentDidMount() {\\n    window.globalFunction();\\n}</code></pre> </figure> <p> Overall, componentDidMount function execute the code everytime after it rendered, that\'s the meaning of the function. There are many soluction you can find about onUpdate event in Router tag or onEnter event in route tag. But, these all are the deprected in the react new version. So, follow this to save your precious time. <b>Please check this post date to verify componentDidMount is not deprecated.</b> </p>","published":true,"created":"2020-04-30T03:25:50.844Z","updated":"2020-04-30T03:25:50.844Z"},{"id":4,"title":"On my way to build mobile application","url":"On-my-way-to-build-mobile-application","tags":["react-native"],"image":"blog/On-my-way-to-build-mobile-application-logo.png","description":"Stepping into mobile application development","body":"<h1 class=\\"mb-3\\"> Stepping into mobile application development </h1> <p>I always wanted to create the mobile application but I didn\'t get much time to learn new programming language and create some really cool app.</p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/On-my-way-to-build-mobile-application-development-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p>Today, my two classes all submission completed.

You\u2019re able to convert your experience \u2014 even your painful experience \u2014 into learning, growth, and change. If you don\u2019t have a future you\u2019re actively striving for, then you can\u2019t actively convert your experience into learning. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When you\u2019re committed to a bigger future, your present becomes far less predictable. Rather than living within the confines of your narrow comfort zone, you begin embracing uncertainty. You begin stepping outside of your \u201cknown\u201d world and begin approaching the world of your Future Self.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Below skills can achieve incredible things in your life.\\n</p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">1. Define Your Future Self (No More Than 3 Years Out)</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Psychologists call active learning \u201cdeliberate practice.\u201d You can\u2019t engage in such \u201cpractice\u201d or learning unless you have a very clear goal. You need a clear goal and also a clear future identity, as the person you plan to become.\\n</p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">2. Start Getting All of the Information You Possibly Can</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Once you\u2019ve defined your own future self, you need to start getting information. You need to develop a clear goal and plan to become your future self.\\n</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-1.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p>\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">3. Tell Everyone About Your Plan</h2>\\n<p>\\n    It takes courage to be open about your goals. It takes courage to be open about your failings.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Mr. Rogers said: \u201cAnything that\u2019s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.\u201d\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    It means that when you become more open and honest as a person, life becomes far more manageable. You stop needlessly suffering internally about unfulfilled dreams or former hurts. You move forward. And that\u2019s the freaking key! Moving forward! That\u2019s where we are about here. Moving forward as powerfully and authentically as possible.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">4. Invest at the Level of Your Future Self</h2>\\n<p>Investing in yourself, then, is also about your network of relationships. You are only as good as your network. The more successful you become, the more life becomes about \u201cWho\u201d instead of \u201cHow.\u201d The worst thing you could do is trying \u201cgoing it alone\u201d on your goals. Going it alone is a demonstration of a lack of commitment.\\n</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-2.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">5. Eliminate Everything that Discourages Your Future Self</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Stepping out of the comfort zone of your current persona and subconscious is risky. It involves uncertainty and courage. Given this fact, you need the stability and support of encouraging friends and loved ones.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Beyond relationships, you need to remove the information and experiences that are triggering your current and former selves. Zig Ziglar said, \u201cYour input determines your outlook. Your outlook determines your output, and your output determines your future.\u201d\\n</p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">6. Write in Your Journal Every Morning About Your Future Self</h2>\\n<p>\\n    There\u2019s a lot going on in your world. Taking 10\u201320 minutes every day, ideally at the start of the day, to express your thoughts and feelings is how you reduce your internal sufferings and make life manageable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Writing in your goals every day is essential to optimizing your life. If you want the best possible results, write about your goals and dreams every day. When you\u2019re struggling emotions, write about your emotions. By giving them form, you\u2019ll stop suffering and be enabled to move forward.\\n</p>\\n<p><b>Be incredibly honest with yourself.</b></p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">7. Define 1\u20133 Actions You Can Make Daily Toward Your Goal</h2>\\n<p>There is a fundamental difference between urgent and important activities. Life is filled with urgencies. But your future self is in the \u201cimportant\u201d category. Anything that is \u201cimportant\u201d can easily be procrastinated and put off. </p>\\n<p><img src=\\"/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-3.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p>\\n<p>\\n    When you\u2019re focused on your future self, you don\u2019t need a big to-do list. Instead, you need a focused and short list. Just 1\u20133 items each day. Count your wins. Make meaningful progress. \\n</p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">8. \u201cEat the Frog\u201d Every Single Day</h2>\\n<p>\\n    If you\u2019re committed to your dreams, make progress on them before you do anything else. Even if that means you must get up early. If you make progress toward your \u201cimportant\u201d dreams, you\u2019ll be a better person throughout your day. You\u2019ll be happier in your relationships. You\u2019ll have better energy. You\u2019ll be congruent. You\u2019ll be hopeful and happy. You\u2019ll energize others in a powerful way. You\u2019ll get out of your head with feelings of regret. Thus, you\u2019ll be more present.\\n</p>\\n<p><b>If you eat the frog every morning, you will live your dreams.</b></p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">9. Report Your Progress Daily to Your Accountability Partner (This Takes 1 Minute/Day)</h2>\\n<p>The above picture turns accountability into a single text message each evening. You report how you did on your Big-3(win/out of all) and list your Big-3 for the next day. There\u2019s an added benefit to listing your Big-3 the night before, and that\u2019s that you get to go to bed with a purpose.</p>\\n<p>\\n    By going to bed with a purpose, you can wake up motivated and with a plan. This allows you to avoid needless decision fatigue the next morning.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">10. Completely Unplug Every Single Day</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Last but not least, you need to fully \u201cunplug\u201d for large intervals throughout your day. There\u2019s a lot of research on Psychological detachment from work. True psychological detachment occurs when you completely refrain from work-related activities and thoughts during non-work time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Research has shown that only 16 percent of respondents reported getting creative insight while at work. Ideas generally came while the person was at home or in transportation, or during recreational activity<b>(Happens with me most of the time)</b>. \u201cThe most creative ideas aren\u2019t going to come while sitting in front of your monitor,\u201d says Scott Birnbaum, a vice president of Samsung Semiconductor.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The reason for this is simple. When you\u2019re working directly on a task, your mind is tightly focused on the problem at hand (i.e., direct reflection). Conversely, when you\u2019re not working, your mind loosely wanders (i.e., indirect reflection).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Creativity is a skill you can develop. As is clarity and insight. You\u2019ll get much more when you take time to rest and recover. You need to fully unplug and be actively engaged in other areas of your life.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    I wrote this post inspired by Benjamin Hardy\'s post on Medium.

I went through many tutorials to find perfect programming language to create mobile application. In the end, I was in dilemma between react and flutter. Finally I decided to move on to start learning react native because recently I converted my HTML site to react. </p> <p> Now, it\'s time to find right tutorial to learn flow, architecture and basics. I looked into youtube, many blogs, official document as well. But, I didn\'t find any right tutorial. </p> <p> Many tutorials are using the Expo that I don\'t want to include in my application. Basically, there are two ways to build native application in react. 1) Expo CLI 2) Native CLI </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Expo vs Native</h2> <p> If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator. </p> <p> If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them. </p> <p> Overall, your final application size will be at least 20 mb using Expo CLI. So, I don\'t want that. </p> <p> As I have searched many tutorials to create application using Native-CLI but I can\'t find easily. Because, everyone suggests beginner to start learning using Expo CLI. </p> <p> However, I decided to learn directly Native CLI. Hence, I dig into it more. In the end, I found really good tutorial to create the calculator app. You can start it from <a href=\\"https://kylewbanks.com/blog/react-native-tutorial-part-1-hello-react\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">here.</a> </p> <p> Also, there is many more tutorials shared by <a href=\\"https://github.com/jondot\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Jondot</a> (github user).

App onboarding is key for one core reason: if users don\u2019t understand your app, they won\u2019t use it. The onboarding process is a user\u2019s first impression of your app, and when designed correctly, increases the likelihood of successful adoption. When a user launches your app for the first time, the onboarding process reinforces your app\u2019s value and provides instructions that highlight key benefits and features. A strong onboarding process is essential to your app\u2019s success.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    I found good tutorial for creating mobile application onboarding.

As you know, developers are keep trying to solve this problem. However, each solution creates the new problem. In react native, you can simply install any new libraries using the npm but there are lots of problem behind this. Developers keep introduces the new features, solve previous bugs, improving architecture etc. </p> <p> In result, they keep update the versions of the libraries and we have to use latest version of the library. But, when you update only one library then it directly affects the other libraries that depended on it. You will find lots of issues about it in the Github. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Multiple commands produce</h2> <p> The common problem that everyone faces in the react native is <b>Multiple commands produce</b>. As I was working on <a href=\\"#/blog/react-native-tutorial-for-beginners-part-2\\">mobile onboarding</a> feature.

So, when you build your project it clashes with other libray and leads to <b>build fail</b>. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Full Error</h2> <p> <figure> <pre><code> error: Multiple commands produce &apos;/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Kopgitv1.app/Entypo.ttf&apos;: \\n\\n1) Target &apos;Kopgitv1&apos; (project &apos;Kopgitv1&apos;) has copy command from &apos;/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/node_modules/native-base/Fonts/Entypo.ttf&apos; to &apos;/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Kopgitv1.app/Entypo.ttf&apos; \\n\\n2) Target &apos;Kopgitv1&apos; (project &apos;Kopgitv1&apos;) has copy command from &apos;/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/Entypo.ttf&apos; to &apos;/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Kopgitv1.app/Entypo.ttf&apos;</code></pre> </figure> </p> <p> I almost spent one day to solve this problem.

Recently, I completed mobile onboarding application. After that, user moved to the homepage. However, when user refreshed the application; mobile onboarding screens again shown to the user. The purpose of mobile onboarding screen to show main features of the application to the user---This should be one time only--. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/react-redux-guide-for-beginners-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">AsyncStorage</h2> <p> As you know, react native manages state data component wise and you need to store boolean flag (ex. userOnboardingCompleted?) to create condition on mobile onboarding screens. So, I looked for the local storage and found well known library \\"AsyncStorage\\" for react-native. This thing worked for me. <b>Do not use react-native core component for that as it is deprecated in new versions.</b> Follow this tutorial to start with <a href=\\"https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">AsyncStorage</a> and trust me it is very easy part. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Redux</h2> <p> Now, I want to use apiToken in every component. You might be thinking: it is easy to get values from the local storage using AsyncStorage getItem function. But, it is bad designing because everytime your application fetch value from the storage so it takes much time to render new pages. </p> <p> This time redux come into the picture. Redux is a state manager. In other way, it is state management libraries beautifully keep logic and behaviours abstracted away from the UI. So, your application reads local storage data one time and stores it into the memory using state. Now, redux passes this data to every component so it will save lot of time. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Challenges</h2> <p> Learning redux is quite difficult as you have to learn many new things. When I approached Redux for the first time today I was confused. There is too much terminology: action, reducer, middleware. But on top of that it wasn\'t clear to me how were all the moving parts glued together? There were some minions or what? In Redux there are no minions (unfortunately). </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Solution</h2> <p> However, it is not that hard if you follow this tutorial completely. </p> <p> <a href=\\"https://css-tricks.com/understanding-how-reducers-are-used-in-redux/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">1) https://css-tricks.com/understanding-how-reducers-are-used-in-redux/</a> </p> <p> <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcC8KZ_Ga2M\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">2) #1 WTF is Redux? | React Native App | Redux Tutorial</a> </p> <p> Above two tutorials are enough to understand the react redux but you have to do practice together and understand concept thouroughly. </p> <p>Thanks for reading and stay tuned on this blog!

Thanks to it, we no longer have to worry about the hierarchy of components. The central store can be accessed from every component to get the current state of any aspect of an application. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/how-to-persist-redux-state-to-the-local-storage-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Local Storage</h2> <p> However, sometimes you may need to store redux state data locally. For ex, storing user profile name, user name can be used multiple components. As per current understanding, you will read and write profile name from local storage--AsyncStorage--. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Redux-Persist</h2> <p> But, you can do this using redux persist library. Redux-persist is a simple library; it\u2019s a wrapper for a store that automatically saves a redux state to the storage. Also, you can define where it should save data, and available options depend on a platform; you can choose localStorage, sessionStorage, localForage, AsyncStorage or we can even integrate it with the custom storage. In future, if you want to change local storage then you have to <b>change in only one file.</b> </p> <p> There are many configuration you can give to the library and it makes your life very easy. Suppose, you don\'t want to store every data in the local storage. So, there is a option to provide <b>whitelist</b> and <b>blacklist</b> components. Blacklist components navigation will not be persisted--oppose to whitelist--. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Tutorial</h2> <p> If you think, it is useful in your application. You can follow below tutorials to get complete understanding about redux persist. </p> <p> <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3aJNTqeXMw\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">React Native Redux Persist [ How to use redux persist ]</a> </p> <p> <a href=\\"https://blog.reactnativecoach.com/the-definitive-guide-to-redux-persist-84738167975\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">The Definitive Guide to Redux Persist</a> </p> <p> I followed above two tutorials first time to get started with redux persist library.

I was maintaining my static website on one repository and created new react app in new repository. Now, I have to copy all previous branches to new branches as it doesn\'t worth to leave old repository. However, it can be useful in future so it\'s good idea to take backup. </p> <p> Copying branches from another repository is quite easy task. You just have to follow below steps. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Repository url</h3> <p> <pre> <code> origin: https://github.com/kepy97/portfolio.git #::Your original repository \\n remote: https://github.com/kepy97/old_portfolio.git #::Repository that you want to copy branches </code> </pre> </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Copy all branch from another repository</h3> <p> <pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/kepy97/portfolio.git #::clone origin repo \\n$ cd git-test\\n$ git remote add old_repo https://github.com/kepy97/old_portfolio.git #::add as a remote branch </code> </pre> </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">show all remote repo</h3> <p> <pre> <code> $ git remote -v \\n html5 https://github.com/kepy97/old_portfolio.git (fetch) \\n html5 https://github.com/kepy97/old_portfolio.git (push) \\n origin https://github.com/kepy97/portfolio.git (fetch) \\n origin https://github.com/kepy97/portfolio.git (push) </code> </pre> </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">fetch remote repo data and show branches</h3> <p> <pre> <code> $ git fetch html5 \\n $ git branch -a \\n * master \\n remotes/old_repo/master \\n remotes/old_repo/blog \\n remotes/origin/HEAD \\n remotes/origin/master </code> </pre> </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Copy old_repo/blog branch to origin repository</h3> <p> <pre> <code> $ git checkout -b old_site_blog old_repo/blog </code> </pre> old_site_blog = \\"New branch name in original repo\\" old_repo/blog = \\"the branch name that you want to copy\\" </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">push old_site_blog to origin server</h3> <p> <pre> <code> $ git push origin old_site_blog </code> </pre> </p> <p> Now, you can see all your <b>old_repo_blog</b> copied into origin branch online.

","body":"<h1 class=\\"mb-3\\"> How to Scroll to a List Item in React? </h1>\\n<p>A brief tutorial which shows you use cases on how to scroll to an item within a list of items in a React List Component. Also, this tutorial shows smooth scrolling. Smooth scrolling is when instead of clicking on a button and being instantly taken to a different part of the same page, the user is navigated there via a scroll animation. It\u2019s one of those subtle UI features on a site that makes an aesthetic difference.</p>\\n<p>\\n    There are many tutorials you can see on the internet. But, most of the solutions are not working or you face somekind of the warning or error. That\'s because of the many functionality deprecated in latest react versions. I will show you latest method to smooth scroll in your website(Still, please check latest method on <a href=\\"https://reactnative.dev/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">react official website</a> to check this method does not deprecated(May 2020)). \\n</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"/images/blog/scroll-to-section-on-click-in-react-logo.png\\" alt\\n        class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Let\'s jump into the solution</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Create global variable in your component.\\n</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <pre><code>const ref = React.createRef();</code></pre>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n    Now use <b>ref</b> variable in your tag that you wanted to focus after scrolling.\\n</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <pre><code>&lt;section className=&quot;ftco-section&quot; ref={ref}&gt;</code></pre>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n    The tag can be anything from div, section, a, span to your manual component. Now create function that handles the scrolling.\\n</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <pre><code>handleScrolling() {\\n        ref.current.scrollIntoView({\\nbehavior: \'smooth\',\\n            block: \'start\',\\n        });\\n    }</code></pre>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n    Next, you just have to call this function and it will smoothly scroll to the section. For ex, I want to scroll when user clicks on the button so code will look like this:\\n</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <pre><code>&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;\\n        Scroll Into View\\n      &lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n    Now, your scrolling works fine. So how does this work? Let\'s get into the details: In order to scroll to the section, we added a button element with a onClick handler. Also section receives a ref object for accessing the DOM node later. Then in the click handler of the button, we can use the reference of the DOM node to use the scrollIntoView API. In our case, we are using a configuration object to make it a smooth scroll to the start of the list item.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Still any doubt or want to create multiple reference, checkout <a href=\\"https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-scroll-to-item\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">this</a> really cool tutorial by Robin that will help you. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If you want to test it, checkout the <a href=\\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/the-road-to-learn-react/react-list-component/tree/master/?fontsize=14&file=/src/components/ListScrollToItemOutside.js:1168-1179\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Demo on codesandbox.</a>\\n</p>","published":true,"created":"2020-05-21T06:03:11.650Z","updated":"2020-05-21T06:03:11.650Z"},{"id":16,"title":"Strangest bug that I never thought about it","url":"strangest-bug-that-i-never-thought-about-it","tags":["react","bug"],"image":"blog/strangest-bug-that-i-never-thought-about-it-logo.png","description":"Apple thinks and works differently.

The is something like 90 degree clockwise. It expects the software used for viewing to rotate the image taken to correct orientation. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Why does it do so?</h2> <p> hmm\u2026 maybe to save battery in iphone, or maybe it will cause a sight delay to save the image. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">What now?</h2> <p> As you thinking, this is the problem in iPhone not in Android or Laptop. To fix this issue, you have to use library that transform the image. Here I found the github ticker <a href=\\"https://github.com/mosch/react-avatar-editor/issues/123\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">The image is rotated in iPhone</a> </p> <p> You can use this javascript library to fix this issue: <a href=\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/fix-image-rotation\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">fix-image-rotation</a>. </p> <p> Still, I have not solved this issue becuase I don\'t want to add another library to just fix one photo rotation problem. So, If you want to see the bug then checkout this post in iPhone.

I\'ll be working on this project alone so I have to gather all the requirement and decide which programming languages to use to full-fill the requirement. I think spending time on project plan instead of directly jump on to the programming is less burden and beneficial decision later on. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Language Selection</h2> <p> When a programming language decision must be made, programs should conduct a trade study to determine the best computer programming language, or mix of programming languages, to be used to satisfy system life cycle requirements. Each programming language has their own benefits but choosing the right programming language saves a lot of time. How? <ul> <li>Easiness of maintaining the code</li> <li>Faster performance</li> <li>Reuse --- You can use existing library/packages to complete task </li> <li>Support --- If technology is well known so you can get lot of support and bug solution from the internet</li> <li>Extent of compatibility with and impact of other related direction</li> </ul> </p> <p> To make a data-centric web app from the bottom-up, it is advantageous to plan below things: <ul> <li>Web front end (HTML, CSS, Javascript) - for the look and feel of your web app</li> <li>Backend language (e.g. Node.js, Python, Ruby) - control how your web app works</li> <li>Database (Oracle, PostgreSQL) - to store the data of the application</li> <li>DevOps (Github, Jenkins) - Deploying / hosting your web app</li> </ul> </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/building-web-application-from-scratch-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Frontend technology</h2> <p> User experience is the number one priority for every business in the market today. As a developer, even the brief you get on your project talks about the simplicity of the user interface it is supposed to feature. No matter how complex functions and operations happen in the background, what users see and experience has to be seamless. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Best Frontend Framework 2020</h3> <p> I choose <a href=\\"https://reactnative.dev/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"><b>React</b></a> over all other frameworks in the market. There were multiple reasons behind this but one of the main thing is popularity. </p> <p> Talking about the relative popularity of each framework, the below graph shows the overall usage popularity of each framework listed for best frontend frameworks in 2020. We can see that after the year 2015-16, Angular and React have been in huge demand. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/building-web-application-from-scratch-1.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p> Also, One of the simplest frameworks to learn \u2013 React \u2013 was developed at Facebook to fix code maintainability issues due to the constant addition of features in the app. An open-source framework now, React stands out because of its virtual Document Object Model (DOM), which offers its exceptional functionality. An ideal framework for those who anticipate high traffic and need a stable platform to handle it. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Backend language</h2> <p> The backend programming language is also known as server side programming. The name given to all types of programs which run on the web server. They process the user input, interact with the databases and control what content is served back to the client as a response to his request. It is written in a number of programming languages including PHP, NodeJS, Python, etc and has full access to the server\u2019s OS and the programmer can chose the language he/she wants to code in. </p> <p> I\'m going to code in the <a href=\\"https://nodejs.org/en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"><b>Node.js</b></a> language. Node.js is the newest in the list (released in 2009) and the quickest growing today. It provides the ability to run JavaScript code server-side. The great thing is that I do not have to learn a new language for back-end development. I\'ll use Javascript as backend and frontend development. It\'s also helpful to full stack development. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/building-web-application-from-scratch-2.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Database</h2> <p> There are hundreds of tech-heavy database reviews out there, but they don\u2019t always give clear guidance on the first step in selecting a database: choosing the best general type for a specific application. All databases are not created equal. Each has specific strengths and weaknesses. </p> <p> I choose <a href=\\"https://www.postgresql.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"><b>PostgreSQL</b></a> database to store the data for our application. I have an option to choose NoSQL database but our application have certain limits so I went for RDMS. Also, postgre is an Enterprise-class relational database system. It is easy to setup and installs. It offers support for SQL and NoSQL. It has a great community which happy to serve you when you are facing issues while using PostgreSQL. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">DevOps</h2> <p> I\'ll use <a href=\\"https://github.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"><b>Github</b></a> as version control software as I\'m the only one creating, maintaining this project. GitHub is occupies by far the largest market share. In fact, it was bought out by Microsoft last year, which actually made people to choose it. </p> <p> Overall, I selected technologies that I\'ll work on. Now, I\'ll create project plan according to our project requirements. </p>","published":true,"created":"2020-06-20T22:04:04.571Z","updated":"2020-06-20T22:04:04.571Z"},{"id":22,"title":"Database Designing","url":"database-designing","tags":["ABB","internship","Project-Planning"],"image":"blog/database-designing-logo.png","description":"Important rules to keep in mind when designing the database.","body":"<h1 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Database Designing</h1> <p> After selecting web technologies and database, I\'m moving forward to designing the database for my project. I read many articles regarding database design. So, I want to list out few important rules that are different from the common rules. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">1) Nature of the application (OLTP or OLAP)</h2> <p> When you start your database design the first thing to analyze is the nature of the application you are designing for, is it Transactional or Analytical. </p> <p> <b>Transactional</b>: In this kind of application, your end user is more interested in CRUD, i.e., creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. The official name for such a kind of database is OLTP. </p> <p> <b>Analytical</b>: In these kinds of applications your end user is more interested in analysis, reporting, forecasting, etc. These kinds of databases have a less number of inserts and updates. The main intention here is to fetch and analyze data as fast as possible. The official name for such a kind of database is OLAP. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-1.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p> In other words if you think inserts, updates, and deletes are more prominent then go for a normalized table design, else create a flat denormalized database structure. Follow this: <a href=\\"https://www.studytonight.com/dbms/database-normalization.php\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Normalization of Database</a> </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">2) Naming Convention</h2> <p> A naming convention is an important part of a well-built data model. Look at the database model below. The model is not very fun to look at, to try to understand, or to code around. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-2.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p> Let\u2019s start with some things that you should consider if you need to create a new naming convention. You want to give name that follows across the whole database. </p> <p> The case of the name. You can choose between: <ul> <li>UPPERCASE names - All name in uppercase</li> <li>lowercase names - All name in lowercase</li> <li>camelCase names \u2013 the name starts with a lowercase letter, but new words start with an uppercase letter</li> <li>PascalCaseNames (also known as upper camel) \u2013 similar to camelCase, but the name starts with an uppercase letter, as do all additional words</li> <li>Underscore - you can separate them with an underscore (like_this)</li> </ul> </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">3) Data types</h2> <p> We deal with different types of data such as strings, characters, whole numbers (integers), and decimal numbers (floating point numbers). Similarly, when we write a computer program to process different types of data, we need to specify its type clearly. </p> <p> PostgreSQL supports many data types. Here, I list out few points to choose data type: <ul> <li>Choose BIGINT for primary ID. Many developer face issues to convert INTEGER to BIGINT later on.</li> <li>Store all timestamps using UTC.</li> <li>Always use a library to perform date and time math.</li> <li>Use a standard time offset.</li> </ul> </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">4) Break data into logical pieces</h2> <p> This rule is actually the first rule from 1st normal form. Better approach would be to break table field into further logical pieces so that we can write clean and optimal queries. </p> <p> However, I want to add here. <b>\\"Break data into logical pieces but don\'t overdose it\\"</b> </p> <p> Developers are cute creatures. If you tell them this is the way, they keep doing it; well, they overdo it leading to unwanted consequences. For example: you can see the phone number field; it\u2019s rare that you will operate on ISD codes of phone numbers separately (until your application demands it). So it would be a wise decision to just leave it as it can lead to more complications. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-3.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p> PostgreSQL supports many data types.

Finally, I found the permanent solution after looking more into it. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Solution (NPM config proxy setting)</h2> <p> 1) First of all, you have to setup the proxy url in npm config. You can get the url from your network guy. Also, many of you can find the proxy.pac file by searching into Windows search -> Proxy Setting. Find below script address and download it. Now, take a look at the downloaded script you will find server name as <b>URL:port</b>. If you get multiple server names, choose common url. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/npm-install-not-working-in-corporate-network-2.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p> Now you have the server name. But, you also need your laptop username(domain\\\\username) and password to set the proxy. Then, follow below commands in widnows command prompt: <ul> <li> <pre><code>npm config get proxy</code></pre> (You will get null first) </li> <li> <pre><code>npm config set proxy \\"http://domain%5Cusername:password@servername:port/\\"</code></pre> (Change 3 values: computer username, password, servername:port) </li> <li> <pre><code>npm config get proxy</code></pre> (Verify, it is properly configured) </li> </ul> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/npm-install-not-working-in-corporate-network-3.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> </p> <p> <i> One thing to keep in mind that, you need to encode the special characters in <b>username</b> and <b>password</b>. You can use this website to encode the username and password: <a href=\\"https://www.url-encode-decode.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">url-encode-decode</a> </i> </p> <p> Try to install the package, hopefully you can install it. However, if you got something certificate problem then you have one more command need to run. <p><pre><code>npm WARN registry Unexpected warning for https://registry.npmjs.org/: Miscellaneous Warning UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY: request to https://registry.npmjs.org/async failed, reason: unable to get local issuer certificate\\n        npm WARN registry Using stale data from https://registry.npmjs.org/ due to a request error during revalidation.\\n        npm ERR! code UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY\\n        npm ERR! errno UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY\\n        npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/async/-/async-3.2.0.tgz failed, reason: unable to get local issuer certificate\\n        npm ERR!

That form was corrupted because there was a coding in macro to generate unique ID based on user input from the form. Somehow it was changed and was not working so, I need to fix that bug. However I don\'t know what macro looks like but I completed this task in 1 or 2 day only. </li> <li> <a href=\\"https://kepy.online/#/blog/npm-install-not-working-in-corporate-network\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">NPM install not working in Corporate Network:</a> The npm problem was kind of frustrating to me because I need to install new packages every hours to building the new application.

Firstly, I created database tables and columns using pen and paper.

Good database design always helps for future enhancements. As you know, there will be always some change from client side after you deliver the software. If you just think about current requirements, it will be very hard to implement new requirements in that system. So, I think whenever you create the new database, spend some more time in a database schema. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">DBDiagram.io</h3> <p> There were many times I changed the schema of the database and it was annoying to me change it using pen and paper.

It\'s not like a drag and drop tool. You might be thinking it will take your more precious time to write the code. I agree that it will take some time but this tool provides a few more feature that saves your lot more time than you think. </p> <p> I started using <a href=\\"https://dbdiagram.noting.io/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">dbdiagram</a> to only see the diagram. You can export the DB design in PNG and PDF format. But there is another feature to export the schema in SQL queries for different databases like: \\"PostgreSQL\\", \\"SQL Server\\" and many more. </p> <p> Overall, using a DB diagram tool you don\'t have to write DB schema queries. <b>You do not required to have knowledge of SQL but you need to know database concepts, db design rules etc.</b> You need to know project requirements, database design rules and relationships between them. So, it is very easy to create the diagram becuase you are typing just the name of tables and column.
