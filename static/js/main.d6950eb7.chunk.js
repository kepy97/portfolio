In fact, <span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\"> international student even can\'t get phone interview so getting a video or in-person interview is a big achievement.</span> In this post, I have written my whole internship hunting experience. </p> <div class=\\"blog-image\\"> <img src=\\"/images/blog/ABB-Internship-Offer-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"> </div> <p> I\'m a graduate student at the <a href=\\"https://uwm.edu\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>. I enrolled in Fall-2019. In the starting of November 2019, I started to apply for the internship application. Big companies already started to hire interns. I show many student posts about they got the offer for the Summer 2020 internship. I was feeling nervous because I\'m getting only online coding challenges. It was a bad time for me. </p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\">Created Personal Website</p> <p> I started wondering about what is wrong in my application. And I figured out it\'s because I\'m on an F-1 visa. <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\"> Companies are looking for long-term players only</span> and they have to pay extra money for sponsorship. That\'s the main problem. </p> <p> I need to do something different than other applications so I thought I should create my portfolio. Many people suggest that resume must be only 1 page. But, I can only put a few information in my resume so a personal website is a good idea to include more project information. <span class=\\"blog-content-italic\\">So, I created a static website before January 2020.</span> </p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\"> University Career & Internship Fair </p> <p> I attended a career fair at my university in the end of February 2020. However, I have applied to more than <span class=\\"blog-content-bold\\">200 companies</span> for software development positions before the career fair. </p> <p> After attending a career fair, I was feeling it is worthless because many companies representative doesn\'t know anything about the position. They were giving a business card or page and ask me to apply through online by a mentioned website. They were not even interested to take a look at the resume. Many companies do not hire international students, they were looking for US citizens. <span class=\\"blog-content-italic blog-content-bold\\">But, I decided to go to every companies table and leave my resume. If they don\'t ask for my resume, I insisted them to keep my resume.</span> </p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\"> Luck? </p> <p> I was getting many rejection emails and few of them are instant emails after submitting the application. I think that\'s an auto-generated email where if applicant select as not US citizen, he/she will get an email. One week passed after attending a career fair. Nothing was working out. So, I even stopped to apply for new companies because of frustration. </p> <p> However, I got some good emails among them. I responded to those emails and scheduled an in-person interview with 2 companies. <span class=\\"blog-content-highlight\\"> One of them was ABB(I got an email from ABB on Friday, March 6th). I went to the ABB site in Wisconsin office on Tuesday, March 10th for interview.</span> </p> <div class=\\"cust-divider\\"></div> <p> The interview went well. I was confident that I will get this job. After 2 days(March 12th), I got a congratulation email from my manager. I was so happy on that day. I like to thanks my manger for trusting me and giving me a chance. Happy ending :) </p> <p class=\\"mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title\\"> How did they got my resume? </p> <p> I did not mention about how I got an in-person interview.

Now on your react component, you have a condition that will render only if the condition is true. This means that initially when the page loaded the component has not been rendered yet. When button toggled this is where that component gets rendered. That child component needs to call a javascript method that was included on your external javascript file or inside index.html javascript code. So, how can you do this?</p> <p>Case 2: Your external javascript function calls when the first time you open the website but when react router changes the component it\'s not calling that function. I have faced this situation to convert my static website to dynamically. The problem was: there is a jquery function that runs on div tags, class, id events. But, in react the page is never refreshed so jquery runs smoothly first time. After routes change it is not execute the function again. So, data was not displayed on my second page due to jquery animation code.</p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Solution</h2> <p>Currently, I\'m learning the react by own so I have spent many time to find the solution.</p> <p>Here is the solution. For exaple, you have function inside the index.html file. In that case, you can use componentDidMount function and call that function using window.functionName(). You can check more details about componentDidMount <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">here.</a></p> <figure> <figcaption>In index.html</figcaption> <pre><code>&lt;script type=\\"text/javascript\\"&gt;\\nfunction test() { \\n\\talert(\'Function from index.html\');\\n}\\n&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> </figure>\\n\\n<figure> <figcaption>In your component</figcaption> <pre><code>componentDidMount() {\\n    window.test();\\n}</code></pre> </figure> <p> Suppose, you have external javascript file and want to rerun whole code then you have to wrap whole code in one function. Add first and last line from below in your external js file. </p> <pre><code>function globalFunction() { \\n    //....your whole javascript file code \\n} </code></pre> <figure> <figcaption>Now in your component</figcaption> <pre><code>componentDidMount() {\\n    window.globalFunction();\\n}</code></pre> </figure> <p> Overall, componentDidMount function execute the code everytime after it rendered, that\'s the meaning of the function. There are many soluction you can find about onUpdate event in Router tag or onEnter event in route tag. But, these all are the deprected in the react new version. So, follow this to save your precious time. <b>Please check this post date to verify componentDidMount is not deprecated.</b> </p>","published":true,"created":"2020-04-30T03:25:50.844Z","updated":"2020-04-30T03:25:50.844Z"},{"id":4,"title":"On my way to build mobile application","url":"On-my-way-to-build-mobile-application","tags":["react-native"],"image":"blog/On-my-way-to-build-mobile-application-logo.png","description":"Stepping into mobile application development","body":"<h1 class=\\"mb-3\\"> Stepping into mobile application development </h1> <p>I always wanted to create the mobile application but I didn\'t get much time to learn new programming language and create some really cool app.</p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/On-my-way-to-build-mobile-application-development-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p>Today, my two classes all submission completed.

You\u2019re able to convert your experience \u2014 even your painful experience \u2014 into learning, growth, and change. If you don\u2019t have a future you\u2019re actively striving for, then you can\u2019t actively convert your experience into learning. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When you\u2019re committed to a bigger future, your present becomes far less predictable. Rather than living within the confines of your narrow comfort zone, you begin embracing uncertainty. You begin stepping outside of your \u201cknown\u201d world and begin approaching the world of your Future Self.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Below skills can achieve incredible things in your life.\\n</p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">1. Define Your Future Self (No More Than 3 Years Out)</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Psychologists call active learning \u201cdeliberate practice.\u201d You can\u2019t engage in such \u201cpractice\u201d or learning unless you have a very clear goal. You need a clear goal and also a clear future identity, as the person you plan to become.\\n</p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">2. Start Getting All of the Information You Possibly Can</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Once you\u2019ve defined your own future self, you need to start getting information. You need to develop a clear goal and plan to become your future self.\\n</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-1.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p>\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">3. Tell Everyone About Your Plan</h2>\\n<p>\\n    It takes courage to be open about your goals. It takes courage to be open about your failings.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Mr. Rogers said: \u201cAnything that\u2019s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.\u201d\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    It means that when you become more open and honest as a person, life becomes far more manageable. You stop needlessly suffering internally about unfulfilled dreams or former hurts. You move forward. And that\u2019s the freaking key! Moving forward! That\u2019s where we are about here. Moving forward as powerfully and authentically as possible.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">4. Invest at the Level of Your Future Self</h2>\\n<p>Investing in yourself, then, is also about your network of relationships. You are only as good as your network. The more successful you become, the more life becomes about \u201cWho\u201d instead of \u201cHow.\u201d The worst thing you could do is trying \u201cgoing it alone\u201d on your goals. Going it alone is a demonstration of a lack of commitment.\\n</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-2.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">5. Eliminate Everything that Discourages Your Future Self</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Stepping out of the comfort zone of your current persona and subconscious is risky. It involves uncertainty and courage. Given this fact, you need the stability and support of encouraging friends and loved ones.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Beyond relationships, you need to remove the information and experiences that are triggering your current and former selves. Zig Ziglar said, \u201cYour input determines your outlook. Your outlook determines your output, and your output determines your future.\u201d\\n</p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">6. Write in Your Journal Every Morning About Your Future Self</h2>\\n<p>\\n    There\u2019s a lot going on in your world. Taking 10\u201320 minutes every day, ideally at the start of the day, to express your thoughts and feelings is how you reduce your internal sufferings and make life manageable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Writing in your goals every day is essential to optimizing your life. If you want the best possible results, write about your goals and dreams every day. When you\u2019re struggling emotions, write about your emotions. By giving them form, you\u2019ll stop suffering and be enabled to move forward.\\n</p>\\n<p><b>Be incredibly honest with yourself.</b></p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">7. Define 1\u20133 Actions You Can Make Daily Toward Your Goal</h2>\\n<p>There is a fundamental difference between urgent and important activities. Life is filled with urgencies. But your future self is in the \u201cimportant\u201d category. Anything that is \u201cimportant\u201d can easily be procrastinated and put off. </p>\\n<p><img src=\\"/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-3.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p>\\n<p>\\n    When you\u2019re focused on your future self, you don\u2019t need a big to-do list. Instead, you need a focused and short list. Just 1\u20133 items each day. Count your wins. Make meaningful progress. \\n</p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">8. \u201cEat the Frog\u201d Every Single Day</h2>\\n<p>\\n    If you\u2019re committed to your dreams, make progress on them before you do anything else. Even if that means you must get up early. If you make progress toward your \u201cimportant\u201d dreams, you\u2019ll be a better person throughout your day. You\u2019ll be happier in your relationships. You\u2019ll have better energy. You\u2019ll be congruent. You\u2019ll be hopeful and happy. You\u2019ll energize others in a powerful way. You\u2019ll get out of your head with feelings of regret. Thus, you\u2019ll be more present.\\n</p>\\n<p><b>If you eat the frog every morning, you will live your dreams.</b></p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">9. Report Your Progress Daily to Your Accountability Partner (This Takes 1 Minute/Day)</h2>\\n<p>The above picture turns accountability into a single text message each evening. You report how you did on your Big-3(win/out of all) and list your Big-3 for the next day. There\u2019s an added benefit to listing your Big-3 the night before, and that\u2019s that you get to go to bed with a purpose.</p>\\n<p>\\n    By going to bed with a purpose, you can wake up motivated and with a plan. This allows you to avoid needless decision fatigue the next morning.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">10. Completely Unplug Every Single Day</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Last but not least, you need to fully \u201cunplug\u201d for large intervals throughout your day. There\u2019s a lot of research on Psychological detachment from work. True psychological detachment occurs when you completely refrain from work-related activities and thoughts during non-work time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Research has shown that only 16 percent of respondents reported getting creative insight while at work. Ideas generally came while the person was at home or in transportation, or during recreational activity<b>(Happens with me most of the time)</b>. \u201cThe most creative ideas aren\u2019t going to come while sitting in front of your monitor,\u201d says Scott Birnbaum, a vice president of Samsung Semiconductor.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The reason for this is simple. When you\u2019re working directly on a task, your mind is tightly focused on the problem at hand (i.e., direct reflection). Conversely, when you\u2019re not working, your mind loosely wanders (i.e., indirect reflection).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Creativity is a skill you can develop. As is clarity and insight. You\u2019ll get much more when you take time to rest and recover. You need to fully unplug and be actively engaged in other areas of your life.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    I wrote this post inspired by Benjamin Hardy\'s post on Medium.

I went through many tutorials to find perfect programming language to create mobile application. In the end, I was in dilemma between react and flutter. Finally I decided to move on to start learning react native because recently I converted my HTML site to react. </p> <p> Now, it\'s time to find right tutorial to learn flow, architecture and basics. I looked into youtube, many blogs, official document as well. But, I didn\'t find any right tutorial. </p> <p> Many tutorials are using the Expo that I don\'t want to include in my application. Basically, there are two ways to build native application in react. 1) Expo CLI 2) Native CLI </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Expo vs Native</h2> <p> If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator. </p> <p> If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them. </p> <p> Overall, your final application size will be at least 20 mb using Expo CLI. So, I don\'t want that. </p> <p> As I have searched many tutorials to create application using Native-CLI but I can\'t find easily. Because, everyone suggests beginner to start learning using Expo CLI. </p> <p> However, I decided to learn directly Native CLI. Hence, I dig into it more. In the end, I found really good tutorial to create the calculator app. You can start it from <a href=\\"https://kylewbanks.com/blog/react-native-tutorial-part-1-hello-react\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">here.</a> </p> <p> Also, there is many more tutorials shared by <a href=\\"https://github.com/jondot\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Jondot</a> (github user).

App onboarding is key for one core reason: if users don\u2019t understand your app, they won\u2019t use it. The onboarding process is a user\u2019s first impression of your app, and when designed correctly, increases the likelihood of successful adoption. When a user launches your app for the first time, the onboarding process reinforces your app\u2019s value and provides instructions that highlight key benefits and features. A strong onboarding process is essential to your app\u2019s success.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    I found good tutorial for creating mobile application onboarding.

So, I have to use react-native-vector-icons library to include icons in my project. </p> <p> But, this libary includes fonts library that already comes with react native original libary as well as with other libraies (ex: react-native-base, galio-framework etc). So, when you build your project it clashes with other libray and leads to <b>build fail</b>. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Full Error</h2> <p> <figure> <pre><code> error: Multiple commands produce &apos;/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Kopgitv1.app/Entypo.ttf&apos;: \\n\\n1) Target &apos;Kopgitv1&apos; (project &apos;Kopgitv1&apos;) has copy command from &apos;/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/node_modules/native-base/Fonts/Entypo.ttf&apos; to &apos;/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Kopgitv1.app/Entypo.ttf&apos; \\n\\n2) Target &apos;Kopgitv1&apos; (project &apos;Kopgitv1&apos;) has copy command from &apos;/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/Entypo.ttf&apos; to &apos;/Users/salih/Desktop/Github/Kopgitv1/ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Kopgitv1.app/Entypo.ttf&apos;</code></pre> </figure> </p> <p> I almost spent one day to solve this problem.

Recently, I completed mobile onboarding application. After that, user moved to the homepage. However, when user refreshed the application; mobile onboarding screens again shown to the user. The purpose of mobile onboarding screen to show main features of the application to the user---This should be one time only--. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/react-redux-guide-for-beginners-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">AsyncStorage</h2> <p> As you know, react native manages state data component wise and you need to store boolean flag (ex. userOnboardingCompleted?) to create condition on mobile onboarding screens. So, I looked for the local storage and found well known library \\"AsyncStorage\\" for react-native. This thing worked for me. <b>Do not use react-native core component for that as it is deprecated in new versions.</b> Follow this tutorial to start with <a href=\\"https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">AsyncStorage</a> and trust me it is very easy part. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Redux</h2> <p> Now, I want to use apiToken in every component. You might be thinking: it is easy to get values from the local storage using AsyncStorage getItem function. But, it is bad designing because everytime your application fetch value from the storage so it takes much time to render new pages. </p> <p> This time redux come into the picture. Redux is a state manager. In other way, it is state management libraries beautifully keep logic and behaviours abstracted away from the UI. So, your application reads local storage data one time and stores it into the memory using state. Now, redux passes this data to every component so it will save lot of time. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Challenges</h2> <p> Learning redux is quite difficult as you have to learn many new things. When I approached Redux for the first time today I was confused. There is too much terminology: action, reducer, middleware. But on top of that it wasn\'t clear to me how were all the moving parts glued together? There were some minions or what? In Redux there are no minions (unfortunately). </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Solution</h2> <p> However, it is not that hard if you follow this tutorial completely. </p> <p> <a href=\\"https://css-tricks.com/understanding-how-reducers-are-used-in-redux/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">1) https://css-tricks.com/understanding-how-reducers-are-used-in-redux/</a> </p> <p> <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcC8KZ_Ga2M\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">2) #1 WTF is Redux? | React Native App | Redux Tutorial</a> </p> <p> Above two tutorials are enough to understand the react redux but you have to do practice together and understand concept thouroughly. </p> <p>Thanks for reading and stay tuned on this blog!

Thanks to it, we no longer have to worry about the hierarchy of components. The central store can be accessed from every component to get the current state of any aspect of an application. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/how-to-persist-redux-state-to-the-local-storage-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Local Storage</h2> <p> However, sometimes you may need to store redux state data locally. For ex, storing user profile name, user name can be used multiple components. As per current understanding, you will read and write profile name from local storage--AsyncStorage--. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Redux-Persist</h2> <p> But, you can do this using redux persist library. Redux-persist is a simple library; it\u2019s a wrapper for a store that automatically saves a redux state to the storage. Also, you can define where it should save data, and available options depend on a platform; you can choose localStorage, sessionStorage, localForage, AsyncStorage or we can even integrate it with the custom storage. In future, if you want to change local storage then you have to <b>change in only one file.</b> </p> <p> There are many configuration you can give to the library and it makes your life very easy. Suppose, you don\'t want to store every data in the local storage. So, there is a option to provide <b>whitelist</b> and <b>blacklist</b> components. Blacklist components navigation will not be persisted--oppose to whitelist--. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Tutorial</h2> <p> If you think, it is useful in your application.

Also, this tutorial shows smooth scrolling. Smooth scrolling is when instead of clicking on a button and being instantly taken to a different part of the same page, the user is navigated there via a scroll animation. It\u2019s one of those subtle UI features on a site that makes an aesthetic difference.</p>\\n<p>\\n    There are many tutorials you can see on the internet. But, most of the solutions are not working or you face somekind of the warning or error. That\'s because of the many functionality deprecated in latest react versions. I will show you latest method to smooth scroll in your website(Still, please check latest method on <a href=\\"https://reactnative.dev/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">react official website</a> to check this method does not deprecated(May 2020)). \\n</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"/images/blog/scroll-to-section-on-click-in-react-logo.png\\" alt\\n        class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p>\\n<h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Let\'s jump into the solution</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Create global variable in your component.\\n</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <pre><code>const ref = React.createRef();</code></pre>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n    Now use <b>ref</b> variable in your tag that you wanted to focus after scrolling.\\n</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <pre><code>&lt;section className=&quot;ftco-section&quot; ref={ref}&gt;</code></pre>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n    The tag can be anything from div, section, a, span to your manual component. Now create function that handles the scrolling.\\n</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <pre><code>handleScrolling() {\\n        ref.current.scrollIntoView({\\nbehavior: \'smooth\',\\n            block: \'start\',\\n        });\\n    }</code></pre>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n    Next, you just have to call this function and it will smoothly scroll to the section. For ex, I want to scroll when user clicks on the button so code will look like this:\\n</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <pre><code>&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;\\n        Scroll Into View\\n      &lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n    Now, your scrolling works fine. So how does this work? Let\'s get into the details: In order to scroll to the section, we added a button element with a onClick handler. Also section receives a ref object for accessing the DOM node later. Then in the click handler of the button, we can use the reference of the DOM node to use the scrollIntoView API. In our case, we are using a configuration object to make it a smooth scroll to the start of the list item.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Still any doubt or want to create multiple reference, checkout <a href=\\"https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-scroll-to-item\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">this</a> really cool tutorial by Robin that will help you. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If you want to test it, checkout the <a href=\\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/the-road-to-learn-react/react-list-component/tree/master/?fontsize=14&file=/src/components/ListScrollToItemOutside.js:1168-1179\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Demo on codesandbox.</a>\\n</p>","published":true,"created":"2020-05-21T06:03:11.650Z","updated":"2020-05-21T06:03:11.650Z"},{"id":16,"title":"Strangest bug that I never thought about it","url":"strangest-bug-that-i-never-thought-about-it","tags":["react","bug"],"image":"blog/strangest-bug-that-i-never-thought-about-it-logo.png","description":"Apple thinks and works differently.

Because of this wherever we view the photo we have the correct orientation for the image. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">How iPhone takes picture?</h2> <p> iPhone, when takes the image it doesn\u2019t rotate the image rather it keeps the image as it was taken and inserts the information with which the image can be correctly viewed. The is something like 90 degree clockwise. It expects the software used for viewing to rotate the image taken to correct orientation. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Why does it do so?</h2> <p> hmm\u2026 maybe to save battery in iphone, or maybe it will cause a sight delay to save the image. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">What now?</h2> <p> As you thinking, this is the problem in iPhone not in Android or Laptop. To fix this issue, you have to use library that transform the image. Here I found the github ticker <a href=\\"https://github.com/mosch/react-avatar-editor/issues/123\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">The image is rotated in iPhone</a> </p> <p> You can use this javascript library to fix this issue: <a href=\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/fix-image-rotation\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">fix-image-rotation</a>. </p> <p> Still, I have not solved this issue becuase I don\'t want to add another library to just fix one photo rotation problem. So, If you want to see the bug then checkout this post in iPhone.

I\'ll be working on this project alone so I have to gather all the requirement and decide which programming languages to use to full-fill the requirement. I think spending time on project plan instead of directly jump on to the programming is less burden and beneficial decision later on. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Language Selection</h2> <p> When a programming language decision must be made, programs should conduct a trade study to determine the best computer programming language, or mix of programming languages, to be used to satisfy system life cycle requirements. Each programming language has their own benefits but choosing the right programming language saves a lot of time. How? <ul> <li>Easiness of maintaining the code</li> <li>Faster performance</li> <li>Reuse --- You can use existing library/packages to complete task </li> <li>Support --- If technology is well known so you can get lot of support and bug solution from the internet</li> <li>Extent of compatibility with and impact of other related direction</li> </ul> </p> <p> To make a data-centric web app from the bottom-up, it is advantageous to plan below things: <ul> <li>Web front end (HTML, CSS, Javascript) - for the look and feel of your web app</li> <li>Backend language (e.g. Node.js, Python, Ruby) - control how your web app works</li> <li>Database (Oracle, PostgreSQL) - to store the data of the application</li> <li>DevOps (Github, Jenkins) - Deploying / hosting your web app</li> </ul> </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/building-web-application-from-scratch-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Frontend technology</h2> <p> User experience is the number one priority for every business in the market today. As a developer, even the brief you get on your project talks about the simplicity of the user interface it is supposed to feature. No matter how complex functions and operations happen in the background, what users see and experience has to be seamless. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Best Frontend Framework 2020</h3> <p> I choose <a href=\\"https://reactnative.dev/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"><b>React</b></a> over all other frameworks in the market. There were multiple reasons behind this but one of the main thing is popularity. </p> <p> Talking about the relative popularity of each framework, the below graph shows the overall usage popularity of each framework listed for best frontend frameworks in 2020. We can see that after the year 2015-16, Angular and React have been in huge demand. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/building-web-application-from-scratch-1.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p> Also, One of the simplest frameworks to learn \u2013 React \u2013 was developed at Facebook to fix code maintainability issues due to the constant addition of features in the app. An open-source framework now, React stands out because of its virtual Document Object Model (DOM), which offers its exceptional functionality. An ideal framework for those who anticipate high traffic and need a stable platform to handle it. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Backend language</h2> <p> The backend programming language is also known as server side programming. The name given to all types of programs which run on the web server. They process the user input, interact with the databases and control what content is served back to the client as a response to his request. It is written in a number of programming languages including PHP, NodeJS, Python, etc and has full access to the server\u2019s OS and the programmer can chose the language he/she wants to code in. </p> <p> I\'m confused to choose between <a href=\\"https://nodejs.org/en/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"><b>Node.js Express</b></a> and <a href=\\"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Python Flask</a> language. </p> <p> Node.js is the newest in the list (released in 2009) and the quickest growing today. It provides the ability to run JavaScript code server-side. The great thing is that I do not have to learn a new language for back-end development. I\'ll use Javascript as backend and frontend development. </p> <p> Flask is an elegant, lightweight web framework for Python. Flask features a powerful request dispatching system (capable of RESTful design), and uses Jinja 2 as its templating engine. Flask is easy enough for developer to pick up and build something over a weekend. It\'s extremely easy to getting start with it. Also, performance of the python language is always great. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Database</h2> <p> There are hundreds of tech-heavy database reviews out there, but they don\u2019t always give clear guidance on the first step in selecting a database: choosing the best general type for a specific application. All databases are not created equal. Each has specific strengths and weaknesses. </p> <p> I choose <a href=\\"https://www.postgresql.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"><b>PostgreSQL</b></a> database to store the data for our application. I have an option to choose NoSQL database but our application have certain limits so I went for RDMS. Also, postgre is an Enterprise-class relational database system. It is easy to setup and installs. It offers support for SQL and NoSQL. It has a great community which happy to serve you when you are facing issues while using PostgreSQL. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">DevOps</h2> <p> I\'ll use <a href=\\"https://github.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"><b>Github</b></a> as version control software as I\'m the only one creating, maintaining this project. GitHub is occupies by far the largest market share. In fact, it was bought out by Microsoft last year, which actually made people to choose it. </p> <p> Overall, I selected technologies that I\'ll work on. Now, I\'ll create project plan according to our project requirements. </p>","published":true,"created":"2020-06-20T22:04:04.571Z","updated":"2020-06-20T22:04:04.571Z"},{"id":22,"title":"Database Designing","url":"database-designing","tags":["ABB","internship","Project-Planning"],"image":"blog/database-designing-logo.png","description":"Important rules to keep in mind when designing the database.","body":"<h1 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Database Designing</h1> <p> After selecting web technologies and database, I\'m moving forward to designing the database for my project. I read many articles regarding database design. So, I want to list out few important rules that are different from the common rules. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-logo.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">1) Nature of the application (OLTP or OLAP)</h2> <p> When you start your database design the first thing to analyze is the nature of the application you are designing for, is it Transactional or Analytical. </p> <p> <b>Transactional</b>: In this kind of application, your end user is more interested in CRUD, i.e., creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. The official name for such a kind of database is OLTP. </p> <p> <b>Analytical</b>: In these kinds of applications your end user is more interested in analysis, reporting, forecasting, etc. These kinds of databases have a less number of inserts and updates. The main intention here is to fetch and analyze data as fast as possible. The official name for such a kind of database is OLAP. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-1.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p> In other words if you think inserts, updates, and deletes are more prominent then go for a normalized table design, else create a flat denormalized database structure. Follow this: <a href=\\"https://www.studytonight.com/dbms/database-normalization.php\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Normalization of Database</a> </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">2) Naming Convention</h2> <p> A naming convention is an important part of a well-built data model. Look at the database model below. The model is not very fun to look at, to try to understand, or to code around. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-2.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p> Let\u2019s start with some things that you should consider if you need to create a new naming convention. You want to give name that follows across the whole database. </p> <p> The case of the name. You can choose between: <ul> <li>UPPERCASE names - All name in uppercase</li> <li>lowercase names - All name in lowercase</li> <li>camelCase names \u2013 the name starts with a lowercase letter, but new words start with an uppercase letter</li> <li>PascalCaseNames (also known as upper camel) \u2013 similar to camelCase, but the name starts with an uppercase letter, as do all additional words</li> <li>Underscore - you can separate them with an underscore (like_this)</li> </ul> </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">3) Data types</h2> <p> We deal with different types of data such as strings, characters, whole numbers (integers), and decimal numbers (floating point numbers). Similarly, when we write a computer program to process different types of data, we need to specify its type clearly. </p> <p> PostgreSQL supports many data types. Here, I list out few points to choose data type: <ul> <li>Choose BIGINT for primary ID. Many developer face issues to convert INTEGER to BIGINT later on.</li> <li>Store all timestamps using UTC.</li> <li>Always use a library to perform date and time math.</li> <li>Use a standard time offset.</li> </ul> </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">4) Break data into logical pieces</h2> <p> This rule is actually the first rule from 1st normal form. Better approach would be to break table field into further logical pieces so that we can write clean and optimal queries. </p> <p> However, I want to add here. <b>\\"Break data into logical pieces but don\'t overdose it\\"</b> </p> <p> Developers are cute creatures. If you tell them this is the way, they keep doing it; well, they overdo it leading to unwanted consequences. For example: you can see the phone number field; it\u2019s rare that you will operate on ISD codes of phone numbers separately (until your application demands it). So it would be a wise decision to just leave it as it can lead to more complications. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/database-designing-3.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p> PostgreSQL supports many data types.

After that, I knew the problem is regarding our office network. </p> <p> Then, I reached to our network guy and he gave me another wireless network password. After that, I was able to install the npm packages because that connection is not behind the proxy. </p> <p> However, that was not the permanent solution. As I\'m building application from scratch, I keep need to try best npm packages to build robust application. When I was switching to the wireless connection, SSO(<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Single Sign-on</a> was not working. Finally, I found the permanent solution after looking more into it. </p> <h2 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Solution (NPM config proxy setting)</h2> <p> 1) First of all, you have to setup the proxy url in npm config. You can get the url from your network guy. Also, many of you can find the proxy.pac file by searching into Windows search -> Proxy Setting. Find below script address and download it. Now, take a look at the downloaded script you will find server name as <b>URL:port</b>. If you get multiple server names, choose common url. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/npm-install-not-working-in-corporate-network-2.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> <p> Now you have the server name. But, you also need your laptop username(domain\\\\username) and password to set the proxy. Then, follow below commands in widnows command prompt: <ul> <li> <pre><code>npm config get proxy</code></pre> (You will get null first) </li> <li> <pre><code>npm config set proxy \\"http://domain%5Cusername:password@servername:port/\\"</code></pre> (Change 3 values: computer username, password, servername:port) </li> <li> <pre><code>npm config get proxy</code></pre> (Verify, it is properly configured) </li> </ul> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/npm-install-not-working-in-corporate-network-3.png\\" alt class=\\"img-fluid\\" /></p> </p> <p> <i> One thing to keep in mind that, you need to encode the special characters in <b>username</b> and <b>password</b>. You can use this website to encode the username and password: <a href=\\"https://www.url-encode-decode.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">url-encode-decode</a> </i> </p> <p> Try to install the package, hopefully you can install it. However, if you got something certificate problem then you have one more command need to run. <p><pre><code>npm WARN registry Unexpected warning for https://registry.npmjs.org/: Miscellaneous Warning UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY: request to https://registry.npmjs.org/async failed, reason: unable to get local issuer certificate\\n        npm WARN registry Using stale data from https://registry.npmjs.org/ due to a request error during revalidation.\\n        npm ERR! code UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY\\n        npm ERR! errno UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY\\n        npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/async/-/async-3.2.0.tgz failed, reason: unable to get local issuer certificate\\n        npm ERR!

Firstly, I created database tables and columns using pen and paper. However, that was not very helpful because it kinda getting tough to change the design everytime. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/how-to-create-database-diagram-easily-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"></p> <p> As a developer--you-- always need to think as a bigger picture for the system. Good database design always helps for future enhancements. As you know, there will be always some change from client side after you deliver the software. If you just think about current requirements, it will be very hard to implement new requirements in that system. So, I think whenever you create the new database, spend some more time in a database schema. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">DBDiagram.io</h3> <p> There were many times I changed the schema of the database and it was annoying to me change it using pen and paper. So, I started looking for the tool and I found out <b><a href=\\"https://dbdiagram.io/home\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">dbdiagram.io</a></b> is a very popular tool in creating the database diagram. </p> <p> This tool is different from other tools because you have to write some lines to create the diagram. It\'s not like a drag and drop tool. You might be thinking it will take your more precious time to write the code. I agree that it will take some time but this tool provides a few more feature that saves your lot more time than you think. </p> <p> I started using <a href=\\"https://dbdiagram.noting.io/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">dbdiagram</a> to only see the diagram. You can export the DB design in PNG and PDF format. But there is another feature to export the schema in SQL queries for different databases like: \\"PostgreSQL\\", \\"SQL Server\\" and many more. </p> <p> Overall, using a DB diagram tool you don\'t have to write DB schema queries. <b>You do not required to have knowledge of SQL but you need to know database concepts, db design rules etc.</b> You need to know project requirements, database design rules and relationships between them. So, it is very easy to create the diagram becuase you are typing just the name of tables and column. I\'ll suggest you to check it out once. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Other Tips</h3> <p> Take a look at your database design after completion. You must need to check there\'a not any cycle occurs. Managing foreign key constraints is a pain but it certainly is possible. There may be problems that arise if you add constraints to the database later which introduce new circular dependencies. You have to be careful in this situation. However, as long as one of the records in the cycle has a nullable foreign-key field, the cycle can be broken and the records can be deleted. Updates are not usually a problem as long as you insert the records in the right order. <ul><li>Check this tutorial to understand circular reference: <a href=\\"https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38655/Prevent-Circular-References-in-Database-Design\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Prevent Circular References in Database Design</a></li></ul> </p> <p> You can refer few other points to create good database: <a href=\\"https://kepy.online/blog/database-designing\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Database Designing</a> </p> <p> Also, take care of the naming convention.

If you have multiple portals for different users, you should definitely go for the SSO. As a user, he/she didn\'t have to remember different passwords. Also, they don\'t have to login multiple times. You can choose a different service provider for your project like <a href=\\"https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Amazon AWS</a>, <a href=\\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Microsoft Azure</a> etc. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Open Authentication(OAuth)</h3> <p> If you want to integrate third-party authentication like Login via Facebook or Google or Linkedin or Github or any other specific site, you have to go for Open Authentication(OAuth). OAuth is a protocol that allows an application to authenticate against server as a user. The recommendation is to implement OAuth 1.0a or OAuth 2.0. OAuth 2.0 relies on HTTPS for security and it currently implemented by Google, Facebook, Twitter etc. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Token-Based authentication</h3> <p> If you have only one portal, you can opt for the token-based authentication.

Also, there\'s a Flask library (<a href=\\"https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Flask-SQLAlchemy</a>) which is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy to the application. So, SQLAlchemy is much simpler to use in Flask. </p> <p> Before you start using it, you need to understand some basic topics to work with Flask-SQLAlchemy. <ul> <li> <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Data Models:</a> <p> This is the important concept of ORM to start working with it. You need to understand how to define your database models in your program. </p> </li> <li> Relationships <p> In a larger application, there must be multiple relationships in the database design. So, you have to tell your program that these tables are connected with each other. </p> </li> <li> Relationship links <p> To connect different database fields, you need to specify links between them in the program. There are two concept in backref and back_populate in SQLAlchemy. <b>back_populates</b> informs each relationship about the other so that they are kept in sync. So, you need to use in Parent and child class as well. If you use <b>backref</b>, it needs to go on one of them only. </p> </li> <li> Join Type <p> After defining the relationships between your data models, you need to specify how to join them when getting the data from those models. There are multiple types of joining in SQLAlchemy like: select, dynamic, joined, subquery etc. Each of those have different meanins, you have to figure out how do you need your data. </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p> The above four concepts are really really important before you start using the SQLAlchemy. I\'m providing the best tutorials to helps you understand those concepts faster. <ul> <li> <a href=\\"https://hackersandslackers.com/sqlalchemy-data-models/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Managing Relationships in SQLAlchemy Data Models</a> </li> <li> <a href=\\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51335298/concepts-of-backref-and-back-populate-in-sqlalchemy\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Concepts of backref and back_populate in SQLalchemy?</a> </li> <li> <a href=\\"https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/backref.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Linking Relationships with Backref</a> </li> <li> <a href=\\"https://medium.com/@ns2586/sqlalchemys-relationship-and-lazy-parameter-4a553257d9ef\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">SQLAlchemy\u2019s \u201cLazy\u201d Parameter</a> </li> <li> <a href=\\"https://dev.to/chidioguejiofor/eager-loading-vs-lazy-loading-in-sqlalchemy-5209\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Eager Loading VS Lazy Loading in SQLAlchemy</a> </li> </ul> </p> </div>","published":true,"created":"2020-08-02T22:29:18.198Z","updated":"2020-08-02T22:29:18.198Z"},{"id":33,"title":"Why .bind() needed in React","url":"why-bind-needed-in-react","tags":["ABB","internship","tutorial","react","javascript"],"image":"blog/why-bind-needed-in-react-logo.png","description":"ReactJS bind() behavior has confused developers for ages.","body":"<div> <h1 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Why .bind() needed in ReactJS?</h1> <p> While working on React, every developer must have come across controlled components and used bind method in constructor. </p> <p> For example: <figure>\\n            <pre><code>constructor( props ){\\n                super( props );\\n                this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\\n            }</code></pre>\\n        </figure> </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">What it does?</h3> <p> Many developers don\'t know about it thoroughly. In this article, I\'ll share my knowledge about it. </p> <p> Firstly, .bind() is a method of <a href=\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">javascript</a> not ReactJS. In above example, this.handleClick.bind(this) function is binding the key <b>this</b> inside to the function to the context of the React Component. It means is that whenever it try to access a property of the React Component, React can access it like <b>this.props</b> since this will then refer to the React Component\'s context and not the function itself. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/why-bind-needed-in-react-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"></p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">What happens if you do not use it?</h3><p> It is crucial to know, what will happen if you don\'t use it. By doing that, you can learn more about that function what it is actually do at core level. </p><p> When you call that function(handleClick()), and tries to console the <b>this</b> keyword in it, you get the undefined printed to the console as the value of this from inside the event handler method. That is because of it looses it context from react component. </p> <p> Hope above explanation helps you. I know this is the complex concept but there are new ways to avoid using bind() method. You can follow below tutorials for it. <ul> <li> <a href=\\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-binding-patterns-5-approaches-for-handling-this-92c651b5af56/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">React Binding Patterns: 5 Approaches for Handling \\"this\\"</a> </li> <li> <a href=\\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">JS Arrow Function</a> </li> <li> <a href=\\"https://codeburst.io/binding-functions-in-react-b168d2d006cb\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Binding functions in React</a> </li> </ul> </p> </div>","published":true,"created":"2020-08-08T15:26:18.198Z","updated":"2020-08-08T15:26:18.198Z"},{"id":34,"title":"ReactJS Project Structure","url":"reactjs-project-structure","tags":["ABB","internship","Project-Planning","React"],"image":"blog/reactjs-project-structure-logo.png","description":"Checkout how to create organized ReactJS project.","body":"<div> <h1 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">ReactJS Project Structure</h1> <p> For last couple of weeks, I was working on front-end Side. I\'m using React JS in front-end. As I\'m building project from scractch, I spent some time to find the proper file structure in ReactJS. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/reactjs-project-structure-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"></p> <p> React JS file structure is pretty easy. Also, I can say that you don\'t have to rome around to find perfect file structure because ReactJS official site provides it. You can follow this patterns in your project: <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">File Structure in ReactJS (official site)</a> </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Analysis paralysis</h3> <p> What is Analysis paralysis? Analysis paralysis in simple term means <b>overthinking.</b> In software development, analysis paralysis typically manifests itself through the Waterfall model with exceedingly long phases of project planning, requirements gathering, program design and data modeling, which can create little or no extra value by those steps and risk many revisions -- <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">wiki.</a> </p> <p> You need to careful about it. As many software developer faces this problem. Even I think I was doing overthinking when I was creating backend structure(<a href=\\"https://kepy.online/blog/python-flask-project-structure\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Python Flask Project Structure</a>). It took so much effort. But, sometime overthinking does not help. </p> <p> Even official reactjs site says \\"don\u2019t spend more than five minutes on choosing a file structure.\\" You can always change after you write some code or when project grows. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Naming Convention</h3> <p> Regarding naming conventions, ReactJS is unopinionated. There isn\'t an official guideline or statement about it. You won\'t find them in the documentation either. </p> <p> It\'s a personal (team) preference. If you struggle to enforce one, you could stick to something like <a href=\\"https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Airbnb\'s mostly reasonable approach to React and JSX.</a> </p> <p> Front-end language gives much more freedom in architecture compared to Back-end programming languages because back-end application could be run on different platforms like ubuntu, windows or mac. So, you have to keep in mind about that. I\'m adding couple of references that is helpful in Front-end architecture. <ul> <li> <a href=\\"https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/solving-the-file-structure-problem-in-react-apps-4b5b5dca775b\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">A Simple Approach to File Structures in React Apps</a> </li> <li> <a href=\\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/2-simple-effective-react-file-naming-convention-tips-cce1022328a8\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">2 Simple and Effective React File Naming Convention Tips</a> </li> <li> <a href=\\"https://medium.com/@wittydeveloper/react-components-naming-convention-%EF%B8%8F-b50303551505\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">React components naming convention</a> </li> </ul> </p> <p>PS: As long as you\'re consistent, I would say you\'re safe.</p> </div>","published":true,"created":"2020-08-11T23:53:02.682Z","updated":"2020-08-11T23:53:02.682Z"},{"id":35,"title":"Big Change in my Internship Project Plan","url":"big-change-in-my-internship-project-plan","tags":["ABB","internship","Project-Planning"],"image":"blog/big-change-in-my-internship-project-plan-logo.png","description":"I wrote about why I changed whole database design as well as many backend API changes.","body":"<div> <h1 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Big Change in my Internship Project Plan</h1> <p> I\'m working on my <a href=\\"http://kepy.online/blog/building-web-application-from-scratch\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">internship project</a> this Summer. I already posted about <a href=\\"https://www.kepy.online/blog/database-designing\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Database Designing,</a> <a href=\\"https://www.kepy.online/blog/how-to-create-database-diagram-easily-without-sql-knowledge\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">DB Diagram Tool,</a> <a href=\\"https://www.kepy.online/blog/best-free-prototype-tool-online-2020\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Prototype tool,</a> and many more. As I\'m working alone on this project, I took care of everything that affects in project plan. However, I need to do many changes in the project plan. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/big-change-in-my-internship-project-plan-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"></p> <p> The one constant in life is change. If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s inevitable in life, it\u2019s change. It may be project planning change, requirement change, collegue change, boss change or any other personal life change. As a software developer, we are used to with any kind of changes. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Project Planning Change</h3> <p> In my internship project, I have to do several changes in database design. But, this change is not a small one. I have to remove a main table of my project that other tables are depends on it. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Remove?</h3> <p> You might be thinking why I have to delete main table of my project. Let me clear that. When I started working on Frontend side, I needed data in some particular format. I can create that particular format in client side but I have to use for loop and change the data format. But, that\'s not the best way to do. </p> <p> So, I looked for a solution online and found that I can create particular format from backend and database only. For that, database should be changed what I designed before. If I made changes in the database, many APIs need to update so there\'ll be changes in models, endpoints, controllers, services, and many more. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Deadline issue</h3> <p> Also, the deadline was coming up in a few days. So, I have to deliver the project at that time. I had two ways: 1) Go with current plan and 2) Make a big change. If I go with the first way, I can deliver project in time. But, there\'ll be performance issue in the project. Also, when project grows this kind of problem always hurts. </p> <p> So, I went with second way. I deleted database table and changed all APIs. Also, I have to change frontend logic. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Satisfaction</h3> <p> It took many nights and many hours to change that. Also, I delivered my project on the time. After the changes, I felt satisfied and much happy. When it comes to positive changes, human brain is still challenged to do something differently. I learned so many things from the change. Also, many pending things became so easy to incorporate in the project. That saved my time. I know this post is kind of messy. I can\'t post whole detail about the problem. Sorry about that.</p> <p> In summary, change is not only inevitable, it can lead to beautiful opportunities, even when they come from the deepest wells of pain and loss. When we greet uncertainty and the unknown with self-care, self-love, and support, we find new ways and our brain finds way to a future that holds many new adventures. <b>Go with the flow.</b> </p> </div>","published":true,"created":"2020-08-15T17:09:02.682Z","updated":"2020-08-15T17:09:02.682Z"},{"id":36,"title":"My Personal Visual Studio Code Setup","url":"my-personal-visual-studio-code-setup","tags":["tutorial"],"image":"blog/my-personal-visual-studio-code-setup-logo.png","description":"KePy style using of Visual Studio Code.","body":"<div> <h1 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">My Personal Visual Studio Code Setup</h1> <p> I love the text editor setup I\'ve been using for the past year and a half, so I want to show off my setup! Visual Studio Code has far surpassed my experiences with other editors which I used for the years before it. I thought I would do a quick write up on my setup and the extensions I love! </p> <p> Its been a while since I moved to Visual Studio Code for every programming language and it has been a great experience. <a href=\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Visual Studio Code</a> is not the same as the full Visual Studio, that Microsoft is well-known for. It is an excellent editor with a plugin ecosystem for most languages and tools. Install the right plugins and you are good to Go :-) Below are my personal recommendations: </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Theme</h3> <p> Since I teach people how to code professionally and give a lot of talks on programming, having a readable theme is super important to me. I also love to have a theme that I enjoy aesthetically, so usually something with a lot of girly colors. My all-time favorite theme is <a href=\\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Dracula</a>. </p> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/my-personal-visual-studio-code-setup-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"></p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Icon Theme</h3> <p> As a software developer, we have to work with different types of extension files. So, there\'s a theme in VS Code marketplace that I loved it to use it. <a href=\\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Material Icon Theme</a> supports different file extension icons as well as folder icons. You can also use custom icons to the files/folders. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Saving Configuration</h3> <p> Another key piece of my setup is my save configuration. Many developers are using autosave code. In that case, your code automatically saved after some delay. However, I don\'t like to use that because I\'m a person who keeps uses ctrl + s button whenever I feel satisfied with current code. If you want you can follow this <a href=\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_save-auto-save\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">article</a> steps to enable it. </p> <p> Most importantly you would like to auto-format your code. So, your code always looks pretty and easy to readable. I\'m using this feature on format code on Save and format code on Paste. Now, whenever you save the file or paste code from another file it will be autoformatted. You have to specify it in setting.json file. Follow this article steps: <a href=\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Formatting</a> </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Programming Errors</h3> <p> Above are the general feature that you can use it for any programming language. Now, many time we make programming errors. It can be typing mistake or import module error. There are many extension that you can download for your programming language and it will identify error for you before you run the code. In python, I\'m using pylint to check syntactical and stylistic problems. <a href=\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">(Linting Python in Visual Studio Code)</a> </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Snippets</h3> <p> Again, you need to find a specific extension to use this feature. I\'m sure you\'re using ctrl + space button to auto-complete the line/code. So, code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements. There are a bunch of extensions that can support this feature in VS Code in your programming language. For python, you can find <a href=\\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Python by Microsoft</a> extension in the marketplace. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">GitLens</h3> <p> Last but not the least, GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. If you are working with other developers, you might be using <a href=\\"https://github.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Github</a>, <a href=\\"https://bitbucket.org/product\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Bitbucket</a>, <a href=\\"https://about.gitlab.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">GitLab</a> or any other version control tool. <a href=\\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">GitLens</a> helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more. </p> <p> Above are my personal recommendations. Hope at least one of those you find it helpful. <b>I suggest you to spend some time on the configuration of your IDE as you will be working at least 8 hours on that every day.</b> It should be configured as you need so you can work more effectively. Happy Hacking :) </p> </div>","published":true,"created":"2020-08-20T12:29:18.198Z","updated":"2020-08-20T12:29:18.198Z"},{"id":37,"title":"Performance Improvement in Project","url":"performance-improvement-in-project","tags":["ABB","internship","Project-Planning","Python-Flask","React"],"image":"blog/performance-improvement-in-project-logo.png","description":"Find out how to improve your project performance significantly.","body":"<div> <h1 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Performance Improvement in Project</h1> <p> Recently, I got some time from the developing the project. So, I thought let\'s take a look to improve the performance of the project. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">How to improve?</h3> <p><img src=\\"/images/blog/performance-improvement-in-project-logo.png\\" alt=\\"\\" class=\\"img-fluid\\"></p> <p> There are several ways improve the performance. Like? You can start first from cleaning up code, removing unnecessary imports in the file, deleting not needed files. Also, you can reorganize your project structure by dividing into multiple components. </p> <p> Above are the very basic things that you can do in your project. After that, you can take a look at your application main section which is used many times when user open the application. This is the section which executes several times. It can be homepage of your application. If there\'s multiple loops are running, try to remove that first. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Loops?</h3> <p> Yes, loops like for, while are downgrade your application performance. You can move that loop code from backend to front-end or get specific formatted data from the database. Always, try to avoid using loops in the backend except there\'s not any other way. </p> <h3 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">What next?</h3> <p> By following above steps, your application will be significantly improved. Now, you can focus on database part. </p> <p> In software application, there are major performance based on backend, and it continuously interacts with the database. You must be using ORM in backend to get the data. You can find many guidelines about how to improve performace in your ORM library. I\'m using <a href=\\"https://www.kepy.online/blog/sqlalchemy-tips-for-flask-database-connection\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">SQLAlchemy</a> in python flask framework. </p> <p> I found pretty good article about <a href=\\"https://blog.theodo.com/2020/03/sqlalchemy-relationship-performance/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Master SQLAlchemy Relationships in a Performance Friendly Way.</a> If you can\'t find anything there are some basic rules that you can <b>avoid</b> like: <ul> <li> Retrieving an entire result set when only the count is needed </li> <li> Retrieving entire models when only a few columns are needed </li> <li> Updating one object at a time inside a loop </li> <li> Triggering cascading deletes </li> <li> Using the ORM for a bulk record import </li> <li> Calling commit or flush multiple times </li> </ul> </p> <p> I\'ve followed above all rules in my project. Now, performance is drastically changed. I hope this list of common pitfalls can help you avoid these issues and keep your application running smoothly. As always, when diagnosing a performance problem, measurement is key. Most databases offer performance diagnostics that can help you pinpoint issues, such as the PostgreSQL pg_stat_statements module. </p> </div>","published":true,"created":"2020-08-26T07:38:02.682Z","updated":"2020-08-26T07:38:02.682Z"},{"id":38,"title":"Why Github Pages to Netlify Hosting Plateform","url":"why-github-pages-to-netlify-hosting-plateform","tags":["react","github-pages","netlify","SEO"],"image":"blog/why-github-pages-to-netlify-hosting-plateform-logo.png","description":"Today, I changed this blog hosting from Github pages to Netlify plateform.","body":"<div> <h1 class=\\"mb-3 mt-5\\">Why Github Pages to Netlify Hosting Plateform?</h1> <p> Earlier, I wrote the tutorial about <a href=\\"http://www.kepy.online/blog/hosting-react-blog-to-github-pages\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">How to deploy React App to GitHub Pages?</a> The hosting plateform of Github is awesome.
