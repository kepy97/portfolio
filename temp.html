        5 weeks completed at ABB. I have done so many great things. I'm so excited to continue work here during the school year.

        Today my manager told me, he has a meeting with his manager so he's gonna talk about the work that I did during 5 weeks. Also, they're gonna discuss about I can work after the Summer or not. I was very happy today as well as quite nervous.

        After the meeting, my manager came to my desk and said: "There's bad news for you. I showed your work to my boss and he didn't like it at all." I was very shocked. I don't know what to say so I stayed quiet. After a few seconds, he told me: "He's kidding. My boss liked your work so much. So you can continue work on this project and there's not a problem to work part-time during the school year."

        I felt relief after all. Now, I can focus on my project and give my best to it. This project is really gonna help me for my career. I like to say thanks to my manager, his boss and <a href="http://www.abb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABB</a> for giving me this opportunity.
