    Here's the common problems that you might face in react-native
</h1>
<p>
    I hope you have just started to learning mobile app development using react native. There are lots of challenges to
    adopting the new technology. I will write about which issue took my much time to solve.
</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/problems-for-react-native-beginners-logo.png" alt class="img-fluid" /></p>
<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Synchronisation Problem</h2>
<p>
    It's not easier to complete the installation of new technology. As you know, developers are keep trying to solve
    this problem. However, each solution creates the new problem. In react native, you can simply install any new
    libraries using the npm but there are lots of problem behind this. Developers keep introduces the new features,
    solve previous bugs, improving architecture etc.
</p>
<p>
    In result, they keep update the versions of the libraries and we have to use latest version of the library. But,
    when you update only one library then it directly affects the other libraries that depended on it. You will find
    lots of issues about it in the Github.
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Multiple commands produce</h2>
<p>
    The common problem that everyone faces in the react native is <b>Multiple commands produce</b>. As I was working on
    <a href="/blog/react-native-tutorial-for-beginners-part-2">mobile onboarding</a> feature. So, I have to use
    react-native-vector-icons library to include icons in my project.
</p>
<p>
    But, this libary includes fonts library that already comes with react native original libary as well as with other
    libraies (ex: react-native-base, galio-framework etc). So, when you build your project it clashes with other libray
    and leads to <b>build fail</b>.
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Full Error</h2>

        <pre><code> error: Multiple commands produce

    I almost spent one day to solve this problem. I have reinstalled all the libraries many times to catch the original
    problem. For that, I have created whole new project from the scratch and caught the issue. After that, I was looking
    for the solution. Many tutorials are said to unlink react-native-vector-icons library but still it's only a quick
    fix. I got many github and stackoverflow issue links but still no solution worked.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, one article from gitmemory saved me. There solution worked for me. You can check whole post <a
        href="https://gitmemory.com/issue/facebook/react-native/20492/557944837">here.</a> However, I'm attaching
    solution if you can't read the post.
