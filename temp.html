    <p>
        National Intern Day created by <a href="https://www.wayup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WayUp</a> in 2017. It is dedicated to recognizing and celebrating the future leaders of the world: interns! Today, I got a chance to enjoy this day at ABB.

        Almost 2 months gonna complete at ABB as an Intern in next few days. It was one of the great experience of my life. I got what I expected from the internship. I'm creating new web application from the scratch by myself. I gained a new sense of professionalism and a clearer view of what it meant to be in the large organization.

        ABB are already helping students to gain real-world experience by creating internship programs like <a href="https://new.abb.com/us/careers/internships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEAD Summer Internship Program</a>. Also, many people in the organization are involved to improve skills of current interns. I attended many professional development sessions, webinars, workshops to improve my professional skills and those are specially for the interns only. Still, many more weeks remaining to learn from ABB's LEAD Intern Program.

        I'm happy that I'm doing my internship at ABB. Thank you so much for this opportunity.
