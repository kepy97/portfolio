    <p>
        Currently, I'm in database designing phase after finalizing our <a href="https://kepy.online/#/blog/best-free-prototype-tool-online-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prototype</a> for the web application. Firstly, I created database tables and columns using pen and paper. However, that was not very helpful because it kinda getting tough to change design.

        We always need to think as a bigger picture for the system. Good database design always helps for future enhancements. As you know, there will be always some change from client side after you deliver the software. If you just think for current requirements, it will be very hard to implement new requirements in that system. So, I think whenever you create the new database spend some more time in schema.
    </p>
    <p> There were many times I changed the schema of the database and it was annoying to me change it using pen and paper. So, I started looking for the tool and I found out 
        <b><a href="https://dbdiagram.io/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dbdiagram.io</a></b> is very popular tool in creating database diagram. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This tool is different from other tools because you have to write some lines to create the diagram. It's not like a drag and drop tool. You might be thinking it will take your more precious time to write the code. I agree that it will take some time but this tool provide few more feature that save your lot more time than you think. 
    </p>

        I started using <a href="https://dbdiagram.noting.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dbdiagram</a> to only see the diagram. You can export the db design in PNG and PDF format. But there is another feature to export the schema in sql queries for different databases like: "PostGreSQL", "SQL Server" and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, using dbdiagram tool you don't have to write db schema queries. Also, it is very easy to create the diagram. I'll suggest you to check it out.

        Also, take care of the naming convention. I chose <a href="https://kepy.online/#/blog/building-web-application-from-scratch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgreSQL</a> for my web application. So, I'll be using "underscore" naming convention as table and column names are stored in lowercase in PostGreSQL.
