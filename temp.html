<h1 class="mb-3">The incredible period after writing an exam.</h1>
<p>
    The mood after the exam totally depends on how your exams went. When the exams paper is done properly well, then the
    mood is already good and you have soo many ideas for you to do in the vacation. But when sometimes paper is just
    like worse then it feels very very bad. You get constant thought about it.

<p>
    Today, my exams are completed for Spring 2020. Exam paper was very good. I got all the answers. Now, I have almost
    three and a half month summer vacation. I have lots of things in my mind to do but I'm feeling strong relief and
    excitement.

    Today, the weather is very good outside. So for relaxation, I'm sitting outside in the backyard of my home and
    writing this post. Enjoying the nature beauty!!
