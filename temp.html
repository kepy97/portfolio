<h1 class="mb-3"> Start the emulator from the command line in MAC OS </h1>
<p>
    I'm developing mobile application in react-native. Manytimes I want to test my application in android device. It's very hard to test application by building apk and run on physical device. If you are developing application in react-native or any cross platform, you might want to run application on iOS as well android device. 
</p>
<p>
    It's easy to test application in ios emulator because react-native run-ios can directly opens the emulator in MAC OS. However, react-native run-android command can't open android emulator. You have to open android studio to start the emulator.

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Solution</h2>
<p>
    You can start the emulator using command line. Firsly, your system have installed android studio. Then, go to the android sdk folder. Default installation path in MAC os is:
</p>
<p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            /Users/yoursystemname/Library/Android/sdk/emulator
        </code>
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Change your system name in above path. After that,
    <pre>
        <code>
            emulator -list-avds
        </code>
    </pre>
    OR
    <pre>
        <code>
            ./emulator -list-avds
        </code>
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Then copy the <b>avd_name</b> that you want to start. After that run following command:
    <pre>
        <code>
            emulator @avd_name
        </code>
    </pre>
    OR
    <pre>
        <code>
            ./emulator @avd_name
        </code>
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
    Now, your emulator will start. Many people find this problem:<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26483370/android-emulator-error-message-panic-missing-emulator-engine-program-for-x86">"PANIC: Missing emulator engine program for 'x86' CPUS."</a> In that case, you just have to go to the emulator directory instead of toools.
