    <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5">Which authentication method to choose for the project?</h1>
    <p>
        Authentication is common way to handle security for all applications. This is only way to answer the question “who you are?” to the application, when comes to stateless architecture or service oriented architecture we got lot of new concepts and technologies in the market. You can find details of different type of methods in the internet. In this article, I wrote about how to choose the authentication method.

    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Types of Authentication</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cookie-Based authentication</li>
            <li>Token-Based authentication</li>
            <li>OpenId</li>
            <li>SAML</li>
            <li>Third party access</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Stateless authentication is used by all around the world. Above are the common practicies for web or mobile authentication. I can say that no one is perfect for your project. But, you have to choose best suitable method for your project.

    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">SSO(Single Sign ON)</h3>
    <p>
        Nowadays, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSO(Single Sign ON)</a> is used by big tech companies. If you have multiple portals for different users, you should definately go for the SSO. As a user, he/she didn't have to remember different passwords. Also, they don't have to login multiple times. You can choose different service provider for your project like: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon AWS</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Azure</a> etc.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Open Authentication(OAuth)</h3>
    <p>
        If you want to integrate third party authentication like Login via Facebook or Google or Linkedin or Github or any other specific site, you have to go for Open Authentication(OAuth). OAuth is a protocol that allows an application to authenticate against server as a user. The recommendation is to implement OAuth 1.0a or OAuth 2.0. OAuth 2.0 relies on HTTPS for security and it currently implemented by Google, Facebook, Twitter etc.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Token-Based authentication</h3>
    <p>
        If you have only one portal, you can opt for the token base authentication. JSON web tokens are mostly used. You can easily find the library or package in any popular programming language. So, you don't have to write code for generating or verifying the tokens. I'm gonna use this method. I found the popular library for Python Flask Project: <a href="https://github.com/vimalloc/flask-jwt-extended" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask JWT Extended</a>
