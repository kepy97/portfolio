     I wanted to learn mobile application. I went through many tutorials to find perfect programming language to create mobile application. In the end, I was in dilemma between react and flutter. Finally I decided to move on to start learning react native because recently I converted my HTML site to react. 
</p>
<p>
    Now, it's time to find right tutorial to learn flow, architecture and basics. I looked into youtube, many blogs, official document as well. But, I didn't find any right tutorial.
</p>
<p>
    Many tutorials are using the Expo that I don't want to include in my application. Basically, there are two ways to build native application in react. 1) Expo CLI 2) Native CLI 
</p>
<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">Expo vs Native</h2>
<p>
    If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator.
</p>

<p>
    If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.
</p>

<p>
    Overall, your final application size will be at least 20 mb using Expo CLI. So, I don't want that.
</p>
<p>
    As I have searched many tutorials to create application using Native-CLI but I can't find easily. Because, everyone suggests beginner to start learning using Expo CLI.
</p>
<p>
    However, I decided to learn directly Native CLI. Hence, I dig into it more. In the end, I found really good tutorial to create the calculator app. You can start it from <a href="https://kylewbanks.com/blog/react-native-tutorial-part-1-hello-react">here.</a>

    Also, there is many more tutorials shared by <a href="https://github.com/jondot">Jondot</a> (github user). Here is the repository <a href="https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native">Awesome React Native</a>
