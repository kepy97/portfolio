<h1 class="mb-3"> Understanding AsyncStorage, Redux: Why and How it can be used in React-Native? </h1>
<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Why Redux?</h2>
<p> 
    First, we have to understand why redux is needed in our application. Recently, I completed mobile onboarding application. After that, user moved to the homepage. However, when user refreshed the application; mobile onboarding screens again shown to the user. The purpose of mobile onboarding screen to show main features of the application to the user---This should be one time only--.

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">AsyncStorage</h2>
<p>
    As you know, react native manages state data component wise and you need to store boolean flag (ex. userOnboardingCompleted?) to create condition on mobile onboarding screens. So, I looked for the local storage and found well known library "AsyncStorage" for react-native. This thing worked for me. <b>Do not use react-native core component for that as it is deprecated in new versions.</b> Follow this tutorial to start with <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage">AsyncStorage</a> and trust me it is very easy part.
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Redux</h2>
<p>
    Now, I want to use apiToken in every component. You might be thinking: it is easy to get values from the local storage using AsyncStorage getItem function. But, it is bad designing because everytime your application fetch value from the storage so it takes much time to render new pages.
</p>
<p>
    This time redux come into the picture. Redux is a state manager. In other way, it is state management libraries beautifully keep logic and behaviours abstracted away from the UI. So, your application reads local storage data one time and stores it into the memory using state. Now, redux passes this data to every component so it will save lot of time.
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Challenges</h2>
<p>
    Learning redux is quite difficult as you have to learn many new things. When I approached Redux for the first time today I was confused. There is too much terminology: action, reducer, middleware. But on top of that it wasn't clear to me how were all the moving parts glued together? There were some minions or what? In Redux there are no minions (unfortunately).

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Solution</h2>
<p>
    However, it is not that hard if you follow this tutorial completely.

    Above two tutorials are enough to understand the react redux but you have to do practice together and understand concept thouroughly.
