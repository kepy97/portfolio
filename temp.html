<p>
    When you have a specific future you are striving for and committed to, your present circumstances and experiences take on a new meaning. You’re able to convert your experience — even your painful experience — into learning, growth, and change. If you don’t have a future you’re actively striving for, then you can’t actively convert your experience into learning. 
</p>
<p>
    When you’re committed to a bigger future, your present becomes far less predictable. Rather than living within the confines of your narrow comfort zone, you begin embracing uncertainty. You begin stepping outside of your “known” world and begin approaching the world of your Future Self.
</p>
<p>
    Below skills can achieve incredible things in your life.
</p>
<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">1. Define Your Future Self (No More Than 3 Years Out)</h2>
<p>
    Psychologists call active learning “deliberate practice.” You can’t engage in such “practice” or learning unless you have a very clear goal. You need a clear goal and also a clear future identity, as the person you plan to become.
</p>
<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">2. Start Getting All of the Information You Possibly Can</h2>
<p>
    Once you’ve defined your own future self, you need to start getting information. You need to develop a clear goal and plan to become your future self.
</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-1.png" alt className="img-fluid" /></p>

<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">3. Tell Everyone About Your Plan</h2>
<p>
    It takes courage to be open about your goals. It takes courage to be open about your failings.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Rogers said: “Anything that’s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.”
</p>
<p>
    It means that when you become more open and honest as a person, life becomes far more manageable. You stop needlessly suffering internally about unfulfilled dreams or former hurts. You move forward. And that’s the freaking key! Moving forward! That’s where we are about here. Moving forward as powerfully and authentically as possible.
</p>

<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">4. Invest at the Level of Your Future Self</h2>
<p>Investing in yourself, then, is also about your network of relationships. You are only as good as your network. The more successful you become, the more life becomes about “Who” instead of “How.” The worst thing you could do is trying “going it alone” on your goals. Going it alone is a demonstration of a lack of commitment.
</p>

<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">5. Eliminate Everything that Discourages Your Future Self</h2>
<p>
    Stepping out of the comfort zone of your current persona and subconscious is risky. It involves uncertainty and courage. Given this fact, you need the stability and support of encouraging friends and loved ones.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond relationships, you need to remove the information and experiences that are triggering your current and former selves. Zig Ziglar said, “Your input determines your outlook. Your outlook determines your output, and your output determines your future.”
</p>
<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">6. Write in Your Journal Every Morning About Your Future Self</h2>
<p>
    There’s a lot going on in your world. Taking 10–20 minutes every day, ideally at the start of the day, to express your thoughts and feelings is how you reduce your internal sufferings and make life manageable.
</p>
<p>
    Writing in your goals every day is essential to optimizing your life. If you want the best possible results, write about your goals and dreams every day. When you’re struggling emotions, write about your emotions. By giving them form, you’ll stop suffering and be enabled to move forward.
</p>
<p><b>Be incredibly honest with yourself.</b></p>
<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">7. Define 1–3 Actions You Can Make Daily Toward Your Goal</h2>
<p>There is a fundamental difference between urgent and important activities. Life is filled with urgencies. But your future self is in the “important” category. Anything that is “important” can easily be procrastinated and put off. </p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/the-secret-of-100-commitment-and-success-is-10-behaviors-3.png" alt className="img-fluid" /></p>
<p>
    When you’re focused on your future self, you don’t need a big to-do list. Instead, you need a focused and short list. Just 1–3 items each day. Count your wins. Make meaningful progress. 
</p>
<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">8. “Eat the Frog” Every Single Day</h2>
<p>
    If you’re committed to your dreams, make progress on them before you do anything else. Even if that means you must get up early. If you make progress toward your “important” dreams, you’ll be a better person throughout your day. You’ll be happier in your relationships. You’ll have better energy. You’ll be congruent. You’ll be hopeful and happy. You’ll energize others in a powerful way. You’ll get out of your head with feelings of regret. Thus, you’ll be more present.
</p>
<p><b>If you eat the frog every morning, you will live your dreams.</b></p>
<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">9. Report Your Progress Daily to Your Accountability Partner (This Takes 1 Minute/Day)</h2>
<p>The above picture turns accountability into a single text message each evening. You report how you did on your Big-3(win/out of all) and list your Big-3 for the next day. There’s an added benefit to listing your Big-3 the night before, and that’s that you get to go to bed with a purpose.</p>
<p>
    By going to bed with a purpose, you can wake up motivated and with a plan. This allows you to avoid needless decision fatigue the next morning.
</p>


<h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">10. Completely Unplug Every Single Day</h2>
<p>
    Last but not least, you need to fully “unplug” for large intervals throughout your day. There’s a lot of research on Psychological detachment from work. True psychological detachment occurs when you completely refrain from work-related activities and thoughts during non-work time.
</p>
<p>
    Research has shown that only 16 percent of respondents reported getting creative insight while at work. Ideas generally came while the person was at home or in transportation, or during recreational activity<b>(Happens with me most of the time)</b>. “The most creative ideas aren’t going to come while sitting in front of your monitor,” says Scott Birnbaum, a vice president of Samsung Semiconductor.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for this is simple. When you’re working directly on a task, your mind is tightly focused on the problem at hand (i.e., direct reflection). Conversely, when you’re not working, your mind loosely wanders (i.e., indirect reflection).
</p>
<p>
    Creativity is a skill you can develop. As is clarity and insight. You’ll get much more when you take time to rest and recover. You need to fully unplug and be actively engaged in other areas of your life.
