<h1 class="mb-3"> Time saver library to manage redux state data locally. </h1>
<p> 
    Redux is a great library which solves many issues related to keeping a state of an application. Thanks to it, we no longer have to worry about the hierarchy of components. The central store can be accessed from every component to get the current state of any aspect of an application.

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Local Storage</h2>
<p>
    However, sometimes you may need to store redux state data locally. For ex, storing user profile name, user name can be used multiple components. As per current understanding, you will read and write profile name from local storage--AsyncStorage--.
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Redux-Persist</h2>
<p>
    But, you can do this using redux persist library. Redux-persist is a simple library; itâ€™s a wrapper for a store that automatically saves a redux state to the storage. Also, you can define where it should save data, and available options depend on a platform; you can choose localStorage, sessionStorage, localForage, AsyncStorage or we can even integrate it with the custom storage. In future, if you want to change local storage then you have to <b>change in only one file.</b>
</p>
<p>
    There are many configuration you can give to the library and it makes your life very easy. Suppose, you don't want to store every data in the local storage. So, there is a option to provide <b>whitelist</b> and <b>blacklist</b> components. Blacklist components navigation will not be persisted--oppose to whitelist--.

    I followed above two tutorials first time to get started with redux persist library. Now, you don't have to communicate to local storage directly.
