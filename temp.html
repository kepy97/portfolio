    I am super excited to share that I finished my first week back at <a href="https://new.abb.com/">ABB</a> as the LEAD Intern! I would like to thank the onboarding team for such a seamless virtual onboarding experience despite the current pandemic. Also, I am grateful to my manager and colleagues for an extremely warm welcome and for making this process, a smooth one.

    No matter how many times I do a thing, I would still feel giddy, nervous, anxiety and all the other emotions which were there when i did it for the first time. This does not mean that I am a nervous wreck it just means that I care about that event too much and want to give my best. On the first day, I had so many questions going in my mind. But, after I met with my manager and colleagues, I felt relief.

    I'm grateful that this company is still able to host interns this summer in this global pandemic. I can't wait to see what we'll build this summer. Also, I'm very excited to see what the rest of the summer has in store for me! Grateful to have a new opportunity and going to give it 110%.
