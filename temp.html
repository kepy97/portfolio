        5 weeks completed at ABB. I have done so many great things. I'm so excited to continue work here during the school year.

        Today my manager told me, he has a meeting with his manager so he's gonna talk about the work that I did during 5 weeks. Also, they're gonna discuss about I can work after the Summer or not. I was very happy today as well as quite nervous.

        Take a look at your database design after completion. You must need to check there'a not any cycle occurs. Managing foreign key constraints is a pain but it certainly is possible. There may be problems that arise if you add constraints to the database later which introduce new circular dependencies. You have to be careful in this situation. However, as long as one of the records in the cycle has a nullable foreign-key field, the cycle can be broken and the records can be deleted. Updates are not usually a problem as long as you insert the records in the right order.

        I felt relief after all. Now, I can focus on my project and give my best to it. This project is really gonna help me for my career. I like to say thanks to my manager, his boss and <a href="http://www.abb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABB</a> for giving me this opportunity.
