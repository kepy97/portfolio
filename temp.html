<h1 class="mb-3"> Final Week of semester Spring 2020 </h1>
<p>
    This is second semester of my masters at <a href="https://uwm.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>. After getting down a routine during the first couple weeks of college, semester will start to move quickly. Weeks go fast because there is a lot of work assigned in class on top of tests and activities. 
</p>
<p>
    In addition, this is the end of the most unusual spring semester in memory. Half semester education shifted to online. There were many challenges but time spent very quickly. During this stressful week, there are exams in many courses. And the exam percentages are high in final grades.
