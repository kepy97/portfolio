                              <p>
                                 As an international student, it is very hard to secure an internship in the USA. In fact, <span class="blog-content-highlight"> international student even can't get phone interview so getting a video or in-person interview is a big achievement.</span> In this post, I have written my whole internship hunting experience.
                              </p>
                              <div class="blog-image">

                              <p>
                                 I'm a graduate student at the <a href="https://uwm.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>. I enrolled in Fall-2019. In the starting of November 2019, I started to apply for the internship application. Big companies already started to hire interns. I show many student posts about they got the offer for the Summer 2020 internship. I was feeling nervous because I'm getting only online coding challenges. It was a bad time for me.
                              </p>
                              <p class="mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title">Created Personal Website</p>
                              <p>
                                 I started wondering about what is wrong in my application. And I figured out it's because I'm on an F-1 visa. <span class="blog-content-bold"> Companies are looking for long-term players only</span> and they have to pay extra money for sponsorship. That's the main problem.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 I need to do something different than other applications so I thought I should create my portfolio. Many people suggest that resume must be only 1 page. But, I can only put a few information in my resume so a personal website is a good idea to include more project information. <span class="blog-content-italic">So, I created a static website before January 2020.</span>
                              </p>
                              <p class="mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title">
                                 University Career & Internship Fair
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 I attended a career fair at my university in the end of February 2020. However, I have applied to more than <span class="blog-content-bold">200 companies</span> for software development positions before the career fair.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 After attending a career fair, I was feeling it is worthless because many companies representative doesn't know anything about the position. They were giving a business card or page and ask me to apply through online by a mentioned website. They were not even interested to take a look at the resume. Many companies do not hire international students, they were looking for US citizens. <span class="blog-content-italic blog-content-bold">But, I decided to go to every companies table and leave my resume. If they don't ask for my resume, I insisted them to keep my resume.</span>
                              </p>
                              <p class="mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title">
                                 Luck?
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 I was getting many rejection emails and few of them are instant emails after submitting the application. I think that's an auto-generated email where if applicant select as not US citizen, he/she will get an email. One week passed after attending a career fair. Nothing was working out. So, I even stopped to apply for new companies because of frustration.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 However, I got some good emails among them. I responded to those emails and scheduled an in-person interview with 2 companies. One of them was ABB(I got an email from ABB on Friday, March 6th). I went to the ABB site in Wisconsin office on Tuesday, March 10th for interview.
                              </p>
                              <div class="cust-divider"></div>
                              <p>
                                 The interview went well. I was confident that I will get this job. After 2 days(March 12th), I got a congratulation email from my manager. I was so happy on that day. I like to thanks my manger for trusting me and giving me a chance. Happy ending :)
                              </p>
                              <p class="mb-3 mt-5 blog-desc-title">
                                 How did they got my resume?
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 I did not mention about how I got an in-person interview. As I said earlier, I went to every company table in my university career fair. After one week, ABB's manager emailed me that he got a resume from the HR department and he was looking for an intern to complete one project in the summer. <span class="blog-content-highlight"> So, the university career fair helped me to get a summer internship in my case even I was thinking career fair is worthless.</span>
                              </p>
                              <div class="custinfobox custinfobox-1"><p>
                                 Interviewing is a lot about luck, trust me, but the only thing in your hand is practice and perseverance.

                                 I know that was a long post but this is it, my full experience and journey into getting an offer from ABB. I was lucky but prepared. Goodluck with your journey!
