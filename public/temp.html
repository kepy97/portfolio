<h1 class="mb-3 mt-5">How to Solve SEO Problems for React Websites?</h1>
<p>
    As you know <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javascript</a> is client-side programming language. So, the browser and Google bot get empty HTML files or files with little content. Then JavaScript code downloads the content from the server and users see it on their screens.
</p>
<p>
    To solve the React web app problem with SEO, you can pre-render the posts or you can do server-side rendering.
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Pre-rendering</h2>
<p>
    Pre-rendering is a common approach to make both single- and multi-page web apps SEO-friendly. <a href="https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-snap</a> is a third-party library that pre-renders pages on your site into static HTML files. Follow <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official document</a> to work with react snap.
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Server-side rendering</h2>
<p>
    In terms of SEO, client-side rendering is a problem, as Google bots don’t get any content or get a little content they can’t index properly. This method is kind of tricky but it's very very helpful in SEO. This(<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/server-side-rendering-your-react-app-in-three-simple-steps-7a82b95db82e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React server-side rendering</a>) tutorial gives step by step instruction to make your react application render server side.

    Overall, Pre-rendering is less complex than server rendering, but also provides a way to improve First Paint times in your application. Happy coding :)
