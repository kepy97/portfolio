    <p>
        In software development, whenever we switch to another project or starting a new one, it always takes some time
        to properly configured the environment and workspace components. In some projects, it takes much time to setup
        the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are always a dependency on other libraries or packages in any project. Some of those packages/libraries
        are updated, some functions/classes are deprecated. So, it will take days to weeks to solve those kind of
        issues.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, there's always a way to solve those kind of problem. As I'm building <a href="https://restfulapi.net/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RESTful</a> APIs in python using flask web framework. In python,
        we can easily install any package using <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP</a>. Also, there is another package that is useful to setup your project in
        another workspace easily.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Virtual environment</h3>
    <p>
        In python, you can use <a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">pipenv.</a> Virtual environment freezes your libraries/packages of same version.
        Now, setting up the project in new workspace will download the same version's of library and packages. So, you
        don't have to worry about versioning problem and depreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Python virtualenv concept is great once you get going, but as we've already seen "getting set up" isn't always a
        walk in the park. This is one of those things that always seems to be wrong no matter how many times you've done
        it from memory. I know it requires lots of time and efforts to solve some weird bug. But I like to say keep
        patience and find the solution. Think about how you feel after solving this problem. It will boost your moral.
        Happy Coding.

        I'm confused to choose between <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Node.js Express</b></a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python Flask</a> language.
    </p>
    <p>
        Node.js is the newest in the list (released in 2009) and the quickest growing today. It provides the ability to run JavaScript code server-side. The great thing is that I do not have to learn a new language for back-end development. I'll use Javascript as backend and frontend development. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Flask is an elegant, lightweight web framework for Python. Flask features a powerful request dispatching system (capable of RESTful design), and uses Jinja 2 as its templating engine. Flask is easy enough for developer to pick up and build something over a weekend. It's extremely easy to getting start with it. I'm thinking I'll choose python over the Node.js
