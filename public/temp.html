    <p>
        Recently, I got some time from the developing the project. So, I thought let's take a look to improve the performance of the project.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">How to improve?</h3>
    <p><img src="/images/blog/performance-improvement-in-project-logo.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"></p>
    <p>
        There are several ways improve the performance. Like? You can start first from cleaning up code, removing unnecessary imports in the file, deleting not needed files. Also, you can reorganize your project structure by dividing into multiple components.
    </p>
    <p>
        Above are the very basic things that you can do in your project. After that, you can take a look at your application main section which is used many times when user open the application. This is the section which executes several times. It can be homepage of your application. If there's multiple loops are running, try to remove that first.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Loops?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, loops like for, while are downgrade your application performance. You can move that loop code from backend to front-end or get specific formatted data from the database. Always, try to avoid using loops in the backend except there's not any other way.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">What next?</h3>
    <p>
        By following above steps, your application will be significantly improved. Now, you can focus on database part.
    </p>
    <p>
        In software application, there are major performance based on backend, and it continuously interacts with the database. You must be using ORM in backend to get the data. You can find many guidelines about how to improve performace in your ORM library. I'm using <a href="https://www.kepy.online/blog/sqlalchemy-tips-for-flask-database-connection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQLAlchemy</a> in python flask framework.

        I found pretty good article about <a href="https://blog.theodo.com/2020/03/sqlalchemy-relationship-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Master SQLAlchemy Relationships in a Performance Friendly Way.</a> If you can't find anything there are some basic rules that you can <b>avoid</b> like:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Retrieving an entire result set when only the count is needed
            </li>
            <li>
                Retrieving entire models when only a few columns are needed
            </li>
            <li>
                Updating one object at a time inside a loop
            </li>
            <li>
                Triggering cascading deletes
            </li>
            <li>
                Using the ORM for a bulk record import
            </li>
            <li>
                Calling commit or flush multiple times
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        I've followed above all rules in my project. Now, performance is drastically changed. I hope this list of common pitfalls can help you avoid these issues and keep your application running smoothly. As always, when diagnosing a performance problem, measurement is key. Most databases offer performance diagnostics that can help you pinpoint issues, such as the PostgreSQL pg_stat_statements module.
