<h1 class="mb-3 mt-5">Today, I have added two new functionalities on my blog that ease of using a blog posts.</h1>
<p>
    I implemented search and tag functionality. By implementing this features, I have learned to pass data between the components. You can follow this(<a href="https://medium.com/@ruthmpardee/passing-data-between-react-components-103ad82ebd17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to pass data between react components</a>) tutorial to pass data between components.
</p>
<p>
    In search functionality, it will filter out data on every character input. So, you do not have to click enter for search. This will done dynamically. Also, post lists are updated without refreshing the pages.
