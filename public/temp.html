<h1 class="mb-3 mt-5">Hide option to Publish to SharePoint in MS Access</h1>
<p>
    Microsoft has been binding Office to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/skydrive" target="_blank">Skydrive</a>/<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank">Onedrive</a>/<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration" target="_blank">SharePoint</a> more and more since 2013. For those of us who don't use the cloud, this integration is more of a headache than a beneficial feature.
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">The Problem</h2>
<p>
    Whenever user open the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/access" target="_blank">Microsoft Access</a> file, the yellow alert bar that says "Save to SharePoint Site" is showing up. However, user don't want to do it but it pops up again and again on starting. Many people are posting about this problem, even I found a post that posted in Microsoft Community page on December 7, 2012. and I found only one reply that posted after 3 years from another user. The user commented: "Sad that nobody at MS can answer this question, even to say "no, it is not possible". Check out article <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/access-2010-remove-save-to-sharepoint-site-yellow/cc0e7141-62fd-499c-a33d-87c11fb60bac" target="_blank">Access 2010: Remove "Save to SharePoint Site" yellow bar</a>

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Solution</h2>
<p>
    The below solution can work on all of these Access version: Access 2003 (version 11.5), Access 2007 (version 12.0), Access 2010 (version 14.0), and Access 2013 (version 15.0). (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access" target="_blank">wiki</a>)
</p>
<p>
    Steps:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Create the new form in MS Access (From Menu bar-> Select <b>Create</b> -> Click on <b>Form</b>)
        </li>
        <li>
            Save that form as "RemoveAlert" and open "Design View" of that form
        </li>
        <li>
            Right click anywhere in "RemoveAlert" form and click "Form Properties"
        </li>
        <li>
            Toolbar will appear on right hand side. Toolbar -> Event -> On Load (Click on three dots appear in right hand side)
        </li>
        <li>
            Choose "Code Builder" from the menu
        </li>
        <li>
            Then it will open Microsoft Visual Basic and paste this line "CurrentDb.Properties.Delete" and Save
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In the end, you code will look like this:
    <figure>
        <pre><code>Private Sub Form_Load()
            CurrentDb.Properties.Delete ("PublishURL")
        End Sub</code></pre>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    Now, just reopen that form. Boom! Now your problem is solved. Try and check it out by reopening the MS Access file. Also, You can delete the "RemoveAlert" form.

    I found an idea from this article: <a href="http://www.utteraccess.com/forum/Remove-save-Sharepoint-t2000044.html" target="_blank">Prevent “Save to SharePoint Site” alert in Access</a>. The user commented to put the line in a sub: "CurrentDb.Properties.Delete ("PublishURL")" but I don't know where can I put this. So, I tried and it was worked.

    Hope this post helps someone. Take care and Have a great day ahead.
