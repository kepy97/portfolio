<p>
    First rule of mobile application is user can understand your application features. App onboarding is key for one core reason: if users don’t understand your app, they won’t use it. The onboarding process is a user’s first impression of your app, and when designed correctly, increases the likelihood of successful adoption. When a user launches your app for the first time, the onboarding process reinforces your app’s value and provides instructions that highlight key benefits and features. A strong onboarding process is essential to your app’s success.

    You can get the source code of the app using git or directly on github. Github repo link: <a href="https://github.com/rationalappdev/onboarding.git">https://github.com/rationalappdev/onboarding.git</a> By following this tutorial, you will learn how to build an on boarding flow for your app. And you’re not limited to screens with some copy, icons or images. You can also have instructions on how to use your app, input fields, and some other sorts of customization controls. There are various ways of doing onboarding. It’d be a good idea to look at the apps with great onboarding to see what they do and find out what would work the best for your app.
